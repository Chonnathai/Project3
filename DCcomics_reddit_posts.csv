DCcomics,"Weekly Discussion Thread: Comics, TV, and More! [November 6, 2023 - Where Did 2023 Go? Edition]",False,14,0,"Hey there honorary Justice League members - it’s a new week which means it’s time for a new discussion thread!

- [*Batman* #139](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81B1DNJ1ccL._SL1500_.jpg)

**For those who don't know:** the way this works is that several comments will list this week’s releases, for any given title discussion you should respond to that comment. For example, *Wonder Woman* discussion would go in the replies to the ""Wonder Woman"" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too.

In other words, you should only be replying to other comments. If you have trouble understanding how to comment for a particular title, please refer to this [handy guide](http://i.imgur.com/NMABCqS.gif). Any unwarranted top level comments will be removed. 

Also, please refrain from posting short, low-content comments on threads for issues or episodes that have not yet been released. Put some effort to generate discussion. Instead of just posting ""So excited!"" or ""Best book!"", try something with a bit more substance, like ""Punchline is such an amazing character! Can't wait to see how they explore her in more depth in this issue.""

DCcomics,What Are You Reading? 11/06/2023 - No More Spooky Jokes Edition,False,7,0,"# Hello and welcome to our Weekly ""What Are You Reading?"" topic!

Come one, come all, to this weekly thread, where you can openly discuss books that you've read, are currently reading, or plan to read. Discussion of all books are welcome, whether they be DC, Marvel, Image, Boom!, Dark Horse, IDW, etc. You can discuss webcomics, manga, or even those mythical novels that don't have pictures in them. Just be sure to keep spoilers covered via Reddit's spoiler markdown `&gt;!spoiler!&lt;`. You can also post pictures of your collection or recent purchases.  

## Flossregularly's Rec of the Week:

* [**Wonder Woman**](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/AVIF_800250-T2/images/I/81sLJmB3AcL._SL1500_.jpg), by King and Sampere  

Don't be that person who just complains about panels of a comic you saw on twitter, read the comic! Love him or hate him, King is undeniably one of the most influential writers of the current era, and most of his stories end up enjoying some level of 'must read' status, even if they get their criticism as part of that acclaim.

And what's not controversial is Daniel Sampere art. It's real nice to look at.

So, what are *you* reading?

DCcomics,Are there any cities in DC that have extensive lore and history as Gotham?,False,4,0,"I mean Gotham history and lore is filled with macabre stories of crime, insanity and even the occult which gives the impression that Gotham is not just a normal city but a world of it's own that is separate from the rest of DC. It is also common knowledge that Gotham is sometimes less of a backdrop city but a character its own right that has its own traits and personality.

Metropolis is associated with Superman but the city does not have the same lore and history that befits its protector in that Metropolis would have long history  and stories of alien and science fiction phenomena before Superman's introduction

DCcomics,Lazarus Pit conflicting origins,False,8,0,"We got an origin for the Lazarus Pit during the Devil Nezha storyline in Batman/Superman which continued in Batman vs Robin last year. In this story the pit was created by refining a mystical elixr that Nezhas father used to revive him in back in Ancient China. Just recently the Gotham War storyline in the Batman series stated that the Lazarus Pit came from the meteor that gave Vandal Savage his powers. I find it weird that the writers contradict the origin in such close of a time period.  It makes it even more confusing that it was established back in the new 52 that the pits and vandals meteorite shared the chemical compound dionesium, giving evidence to support this origin.

DCcomics,What's something DC pushed for years but fans never cared for?,False,351,0,"What is something that DC tried to go with but just didn't click with fans?

Barbara Gordon being adopted is one major example I can think of. After the first Crisis, DC accidentally made James too young to be Babs' father, especially since he had a son in Batman: Year One. A workaround was that Babs is Jim's niece who he adopted when she was ten after her biological parents died.

Almost no Barbara Gordon fan I know treats this as a thing. I've only seen a few people say they prefer Babs being adopted, because they like the father/daughter relationship regardless of blood. 

This was canon from the late 80s to the early 2010s but it's a little known fact nevertheless. It was seldom mentioned in the comics. Adaptations *never* reference it. I have heard that a 2000s comic implied Babs was actually Jim's through cheating with his sister-in-law. The New 52 did away with it and now Babs is back to being Jim's bio daughter.",,427,,351,,public

DCcomics,"You know, I really like Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay.",False,1,0,"Though, to be fair, it's a little iffy with the resurrection of RF, but the amazing part of it and my all-time favorite ending of any movie ever is the death of Bronze Tiger who was really a good guy but he chose to funnel his grief into being an anti-hero. And surely, at the end of his life, he was likely to go to Hell, if Deadshot hadn't used the Get-out-of-Hell-free card, insuring Bronze Tiger would be able to reunite with his wife in Heaven. It has to be the best bittersweet ending to a movie I've seen in a while but not only does Deadshot follow it up with one of the best lines possible; ""Huh. Well I'll be damned."" (literally, of course, he's a Hitman/Mercenary) does one of if not my favorite scenes in the DCAU happen.

DCcomics,Blue Beetle &amp; Birds of Prey,False,1,0,"Oh, boy! I am thoroughly enjoying the pacing of this two series and I’m glad they’re ongoing. The story pacing is enough to carry me through the issue and make me excited for the next issue.

ALSO, the art style on both comics are so damn good. Leo Romero &amp; Jordie Bellaire’s work on BOP is so attractive and charming it breathes new life to these characters and makes it feel like I’m going on a crazy acid superhero adventure. I’m excited for what Kelly Thompson is going to wrote for these ladies and what dynamics they can come up with.

Adrian Gutierrez &amp; Will Quintana’s work adds a certain spunk on Blue Beetle &amp; Palmera city. I particularly love the fish eye perspective and the action sequences. I enjoy how it’s very hand drawn and not crisp which adds a certain youth to the comic. I’m enjoying Josh Trujillo’s writing on this- especially with the latest issue- bringing Traci 13, Oblivion Bar, and Madame Xanadu?!?!

I'm in an english in college and for our final we are writing about superheroes. Thing is, the professor is super lax on the definition so we can write about villains and anti-heroes (she literally said Lord of the Rings is a superhero film). So I've decided that I'll be writing about Harley Quinn since she is a favorite of mine. For the essay I'll be talking about the animated Batman series, Birds of Prey, and Harley Quinn: Breaking Glass to show a small insight to how she has evolved over time. But this is where I need help.

What episodes from the animated Batman series should I rewatch that are Harley focused/centered or would be good for my essay?

DCcomics,"[Cosplay] (self) Batman, classic blue and gray, real armor",False,106,0,"HIGHLIGHTS:

• Classic blue and gray color scheme as an homage to the DCAU and comics.

• 3D-printed temperature-resistant PETG cowl which I modeled to conform to my head. Nearly perfect vision and hearing even with white eye mesh. Perfect articulation due to two-piece design with balaclava underneath, and enough room built into the eyes to prevent discomfort from the mesh.

• Functional riot armor, able to withstand any non-ballistic attacks (not that I plan on doing any crime-fighting!). Plan to repaint a bit in the future.

• Magnetic holsters I built for the thigh guards which allow the attachment of three or four steel batarangs and a grapnel gun prop.

• Utility belt has several custom props, including a dispenser I built for harmless bang-snap explosives (basically tiny firecrackers). Also has a shard of ""kryptonite,"" a portable fan, power bank, flashlight/blacklight, metal prop handcuffs, lollipops (for Halloween, and for relaxing any young kiddos who get a little spooked), a small med-kit, and more.

• Several working gadgets secretly stored throughout the arms and legs of the costume, including multitools, a permanent marker, and a plasma arc lighter.

• T6 6061 aircraft aluminum forearm gauntlets with affixed cold steel plates to allow me to magnetically attach my smartphone. Commissioned those from a Canadian engineer on Etsy.

• Cape was made by a talented Ukrainian seamstress (also via Etsy) to fit my specifications for height, shape, color, and the added collar inspired by the design from Batman: White Knight.

• Molded PVC velcro patch bat symbol of my own design. Combines my favorite iterations.

• Equestrian half-chaps over tactical boots to provide the classic long-boot look without sacrificing comfort or ankle articulation.

And more.

Wish I had some better pictures, but haven't had many chances to bring it out yet.

DCcomics,[Character of the Month] Flex Mentallo,False,9,0,"## [Flex Mentallo](https://i.imgur.com/1gMyjdI.png)

**Created by:** Grant Morrison &amp; Richard Case

**First Appearance:** *Doom Patrol* (1987-1995) #35

**Affiliated Organizations:** Doom Patrol

**Strengths/Abilities:** Muscle Mystery (who needs anything else!?)

The Doom Patrol's famous Man of Muscle Mystery, Flex Mentallo first appeared in the beloved Grant Morrison &amp; Richard Case run of the series. Flex was a young man who filled out a mail-in coupon in order to gain access to a book. This wasn't just any book, however; it allowed Flex to gain the powers of Muscle Mystery, allowing him to control the very nature of reality through flexing his muscles!

Unfortunately, he ended up captured by a shadowy organization called the Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E. for years. He eventually escaped, but as an amnesiac, until the point where he was found and taken in by Danny the Street. When the Doom Patrol eventually visited Danny the Street, he regained his lost memories.

Taking on the Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E. with the help of the Doom Patrol, Flex learned that he was, in fact, a comic book character created by a man named Wally Sage, who had brought Flex to life with the power of his imagination. Upon the defeat of the Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E. and the death of Sage, Flex left the team, only returning to them decades later in the Young Animal series.

In that run, he once again inhabited Danny, helping out the team when necessary. He got a fun little story where he returned to his old beach to restore it to its former glory. He also appears in the recently concluded Unstoppable Doom Patrol series, and will presumably continue to appear if the series gets renewed for a second season as the creators have hinted may happen.

DCcomics,Batman’s don’t kill rule is stupid.,False,0,0,"And before people come in here telling me it’s the Justice System’s fault for not executing these criminals… Batman operates outside the law. So does he just decided when and where the law should be applied out of personal opinion? If so, doesn’t that defeat the whole point of law and order. If Batman is “justice” then why does he critically injure people beyond comprehension? Doesn’t that count towards assault/battery? Also, every one of his villains who have taken lives after escaping prison is a result of Batman’s own unwillingness to kill. Hell, I’d even consider it his own pride at stake. He doesn’t want to admit that death is the only option. 

Obviously taking a life isn’t easy, but choosing between a maniac clown and an innocent civilian? Pretty easy damn choice. And anyone who thinks that it would lead him down a road of wrong-doing, then that is his own fault. Any normal person can make the choice of killing a good person vs a bad person. If he forfeits the ability to make the clear choice then that is his own fault and she be punished for it.

Personally, I am a bit tired of DC trying to fix Hawkman. They messed up badly, and now the character is ruined. Everything they have done has just messed him even worse. And why is he hyped as such a great hero? His combat strategies tend to just be ""Fly to someone while Berserking with your mace"", and it's not like his powers are that unique, nor is his lore. 

The only reason he is still used is because the Justice League cartoon had Hawkgirl. No writer short of Horatio could make Carter work, and DC should just anticlimatically kill him as cannon fodder for his next event, ""Crisis of Infinite Batmans: Multiversal Mayhem""",,140,,4,,public

With this spirit in mind, these Q'n'A topics are intended to give those who may be puzzled a centralized place to connect with other knowledgable readers and clear up some confusion.

A new Ask the Veterans thread is posted every Sunday, and in the future answers to these questions will be organized into this subreddit's wiki page.

DCcomics,Some basic ideas I had for potential mechanics/gameplay of this hypothetical AAA Superman game,False,2,0,"I was just wandering about the potential mechanics and trying to make it fun in my own mind, so I ended up falling in a significantly deeper rabbit hole than I originally anticipated and now I'm essentially torturing myself by going more in depth with the game that probably won't be made in a long time, so I might as well attempt to make some of yall suffer with me.

Metropolis being fully explorable is obviously a non brainer and now is the time better than ever to say definitively that it shouldn't be a problem to load with Supes' speed considering we're on the new system now. There should be options for other explorable sections, not nearly as detailed as Metropolis obviously, but Fortress of Solitude and Smallville are non brainers, Warworld, Apokolips, Brainiac's ship depending on who the main baddy you want for it, which we'll get to later.

Metropolis SHOULD look like unachievably futuristic and modern, I don't want it to look like any normal city, Gotham and Metropolis were always kind of the extremes, it'd feel wrong if neither were heavily modified to amplify the tone.

Another reason why I think utilizing multiple explorable worlds for Superman would be a good decision is because of a potentially most controversial topic when it comes to a Superman game, the complaint that Superman is just too OP for a game. I think in Metropolis after you beat the main story, you shouldn't be killable and you can just immerse yourself as this godlike being, but if you actually want a challenge after the main game, you go to somewhere else where there are also extremely powerful beings like yourself where you can in fact get damaged quite easily.

Now despite the fact that there are thousands of games where you can die to someone where that main character shouldn't possibly ever die to, you can't deny that there isn't something truly iconic about the big blue just slowly approaching the rain of bullets, every single one of them ricocheting off of him, that shit would just not get old for me, I remember in Lego Batman how fun it was that Superman literally couldn't be damaged, but that wouldn't make a fun game overall, so I think it's a smart move to secure Metropolis as the ""safe zone"" for when you beat all the main and side missions, and then you can leave Warworld as a combat wave place or something, I dunno.

I think it'd make a neat progression of the game to make like first 2 or 3 levels much smaller scale where Superman CAN'T REALLY BE directly hurt and implement some of those ideas of a city meter, or something similar, where too much destruction would cause death, but after that, as stronger villains get introduced, you'd need to start being careful cuz you could die fairly quickly.

Now realistically, if this WAS made, you'd probably expect it to be a trilogy, like the first game would be much more Metropolis centered with the main villain as Lex obviously, the second game could probably be Krypton centered with Brainiac, Zod and whatnot and then the final one could be Justice League connected with Darkseid as the big bad, but it's kind of reductive to pretend as if I'm inventing this new game from scratch, and immediately following up with a next game where I'd ""add some updates"", like it doesn't make sense, so we'll just pretend like that doesn't matter.

Obviously shoving all iconic Superman villains like Luthor, Brainiac, Zod, Doomsday etc. into a singular game would feel ridiculously cluttered, but it also feels like a disservice NOT to include them, so I'd like to see some of yours opinions on what should the general premise be. I was imagining something way more simple and linear, akin to Arkham Asylum, but obviously way grander and bigger. The charm of that game is that you can imagine it being one of the comics, but if also feels like a new universe, that kind of charm I'd like to see being replicated, where the history is already kind of implied, Lois would know who he is, characters like Steel or Supergirl would be implied as existent etc.

The thing I'm mostly excited about to discuss is the gameplay, let me preface this by saying I am in no way, shape or form experienced or familiar with the way this works, I literally just picked up a controller and imagined what I think would be fun to do, it was probably the biggest copium I've ever inhaled in my life, but take that aside.

Here's a shitty sketch of how buttons would operate:

https://preview.redd.it/mby5k66q3fyb1.png?width=1237&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03f050440bcc7ca815411abf2068b93d5168fb97

Square and Triangle would be your bread and butter for attacks, press square multiple times for the most basic ahh combo, once you grab an enemy type, you'd have a variety of different options to do something with them, whether it's to throw them at someone else, throw them into space, slam them against the ground or whatever.

In those moments, whenever you'd hold L2, you could choose where you'd throw the said enemy type.

If square is held, it's start a launcher, which sends enemies airborne, or airborne-er, since air combat is a no brainer and majority high level fights would be in the air anyway.

I think a genuinely VERY FUN game mechanic could be utilized with the Aim, so before you truly start kicking ass and connect multiple hits one after another and build your momentum, if you want to jump STRAIGHT INTO THE ACTION, if you hold L2 and THEN press square, he'd do his signature move that was pretty much cemented into every piece of media.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1580v2y/i\_love\_that\_this\_punch\_has\_become\_supermans\_thing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1580v2y/i_love_that_this_punch_has_become_supermans_thing/) is what I'm referencing to be specific.

If the aim was initiated and you pressed grab, I'd imagine Superman pretty much INSTANTLY going to the enemy and grabbing them, like I'm straight up talking whoosh, he's here. Describing it sounds so simple, but as I was imagining it, the amount of POWER you'd feel is the exact type of shit I am personally looking for.

Some string attacks I was imagining that could only serve as cool visuals, because as mechanically fun I want the game to be, the variety of animation is also important, that's why at no point does Batman in Arkham games feel repetitive in his combat despite you only having a single button. So if you were to launch someone while holding square and you'd press triangle, Clark would grab them by their leg and throw them into the direction you're subtly pointing towards, if the enemy is in that direction, it will automatically hit them, regardless of their elevation.

But offenses aside, you gotta have a defense, and for Superman I think a parry is most appropriate. DEFINITELY not a counter like for Batman, dodge is for Spider-Man (although he has a parry now too but ignore that) but I think a simple animation of Supes puffing his chest to deflect the hit fits quite well for the character.

X would be served for traversals. The moment you press it, Clark'd get off the ground and start levitating Minecraft creative style, if you hold the button, he'd go much faster in his iconic flying pose, but to the point where you could still appreciate the world around you. Double tapping and holding X would be used for whenever you'd essentially want to cross the entire map in literal seconds.

If you're on the ground and then you double tap, Clark would instantly fly couple of miles in the sky in a split second. The actual flying itself shouldn't be too difficult, you just fly wherever you're pointing towards with your left stick.

Super senses is... detective vision/spider sense, not the most pleasant way to describe it, but it's essentially the truth. I don't exactly know HOW would you differentiate it enough to the point where it doesn't feel too alienated from the powers Clark actually has, but also isn't literally just copy paste of those two mechanics, if anyone has a better idea, I'd love to hear it, let's say I'm just laying down the script so anyone potentially gets motivated to think of something better than I do.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/218m2muf7fyb1.png?width=952&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13ce8170a81a9e0d71937ece39953493b9daeb69

Aside from your health bar, you'd have the solar energy meter, which is basically used for Superman's iconic, more ranged superpowers. The higher you are, the faster it'd refill, if enemies have kryptonite, it'll refill slower. If the enemies posses magical powers, upon every hit, your solar energy would decrease just as much as your health would, if the red solar power is in area, it refills even slower.

The up,down,left,right buttons would just be a quick way to shift between your powers. You'd have heat vision, freeze breath, super breath and... tiny Superman jumping from your hand or something, we'll work on that, once again, someone can recommend the fourth ability, or maybe it doesn't need to be a fourth ability and you have another request that can fill the down button.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/60mwan3j8fyb1.png?width=946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=289916fde882295357d1df68d080b44f2d2769c4

L1 would be used to fire those said powers, by tapping it, you'd do slight attacks based on the purpose. If you tap heat vision, you'll send a decently damaging ranged attack.

If you tap super breath, you can push your enemies away if you're getting overwhelmed.

If you tap freezing breath, you slow down the enemies nearby you.

Freeze takes the least amount of solar energy, heat vision the most.

By holding L1, you'd use more of the meter as well as dealing more impactful blows. Heat vision would spawn a giant laser that would tear through everything in it's path. Super breath would suck every single enemy in the area, stunned, rendering them defenseless to hit them all in a single motion.

Freezing breath wouldn't just slow them down, but completely freeze them for couple of seconds, tougher enemies or bosses would only be slowed down though, I think it makes it fair seeing as how freeze would decrease the least of your meter, so it balances it out.

Ok this next idea I'm genuinely contemplating whether it'd be too broken or OP, you can help me decide.

Ignore the shitty MSPaint yellow ""glow"" which is meant to emulate the Sun, whenever your meter is full, you could active super speed, which would completely decrease your meter, but while it's leaking, EVERY SINGLE ENEMY TYPE would be completely frozen, and you'd gain a slight boost in speed as well. Everything around you would move warped, as if you're in water. Dust would be set in place, shock waves as you're punching someone etc.

https://preview.redd.it/hy9dfnrg9fyb1.png?width=922&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=492d9edc492f8a5c38f1f2a8e1f9e196684b76e3

Again, as much as I'm trying to make it fair and square, I also want the game to make you feel RIDICULOUSLY COOL, and this would do it for me certainly.

As for some of the side content, you could have a series of missions following Myx where he gives you a variety of trolling, reality warping missions until you somehow trick him by the end. These missions should fuck with you, reversed controls for one seems like an appropriate decision, maybe a section where you play a more toonified Portal, but instead of it being just two wormholes, you could physically pick up the hole and place it somewhere else for a neat little puzzle.

I think having missions where you're Clark Kent doing regular investigating could also be nice, more stealth oriented sections where you'd need to use your wit and powers subtly enough so that no one notices.

I think during these sections, a nice gameplay switch would be to change your established superpowers into three other ones, like changing his voice to make it sound like the guy you're trying to take down, or super hearing where you can gather extra information about an underworld organization or something. You could have a single main mission where that'd be set up, but it shouldn't be overdone in the main story.

Yeah that's mostly it, what do yall think, do you have ideas you think could work better to replace some of my own decisions, maybe some ideas that are just ADDING onto the skeleton I already established, like a combination of buttons to make him do a special move or something, I didn't want to get too into it, cuz once again, I don't know exactly how this type of combat is exactly supposed to operate.",,1,,2,,public

He is the perfect mix of superman and batman without any of their flaws, He have the optimism and idealism of superman but also pragmatic enough to make the hard call, He have Bruce's strategic mind and discipline without the paranoia and controlling nature

I wonder why Chip decided to put that many time jumps in his run, first two weeks then a big eight weeks (post-Knight Terrors or during ""Dawn of DC""). It's already quite hard to put a sensible Batman timeline - especially since we also have the Orghams in Ram V's Detective Comics - which so far don't have any, big ones at least (it entered ""Dawn"" with maybe 1070 or 1071). Then we also have other characters like Nightwing, Catwoman, Joker (or ""Joker"") running around - which also have their own ongoings and/or cameos (in Tec).",,15,,15,,public

DCcomics,[discussion] if you were to change up a lot of the Characters' Nationalities where would you have them be from?,False,0,0,"I think it would make sense for there to at least be a continuous elseworld series about this concept of taking the A out of the JLA (or rather having it be one of many letters they help) considering how these characters aren't just limited to helping problems in the US

Anyway though, I feel like it'd make sense for each founding member of the League to be from different countries, Superman would probably still be from the US in a sort of ""change all the ore textures except for Diamond"" way, for everyone else I have a few different ideas. Batman is likely from somewhere in Europe (either The UK or Eastern Europe) but he could also be from East Asia (probably Japan or South Korea) 

Obviously Wonder Woman would likely be from Themyscira and therefore Greece, but maybe Themyscira moved to like South America or something (and the warrior women the Amazon river was named after were in fact from Themyscira) either that or making another mythical land her home (probably like El Dorado or Hyperborea or something) 

NGL I feel like it makes sense for Flash to be Australian, not just because one version of Johnny Quick (his Earth 3 Counterpart) was but also because there could be a few good places to test his running without A-Training anyone (mostly The Outback) yeah I know that's not really how Speedforce reaction times work but it'd still help (also for some reason I keep imagining him as Aboriginal just because... I don't know)

there are multiple different Earth Green Lanterns that get to be founding members so just pick one and change the country I guess

Aquaman would definitely have to be in a coastal country, maybe even a country that is most well known for coasts so I'll just list a bunch of countries I think could work. Spain, Portugal, Senegal (a friend of mine is from there) Haiti, Dominican Republic, Italy, Norway, Iceland, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Cameroon, Venezuela, The Bahamas, Bermuda. you get the idea

I'm a long time DC Comics fan that went cold turkey about eight years ago. I'm back on the hobby and I have a challenge for 2024: To read all the important events since *Crisis on Infinite Earths* in chronological order.

I have some TPBs of those events but I know I don't have all the ones that I want to read to have a general perspective of the actual continuity. I need your knowledge to recommend me some TPBs that follow these three rules:

\- The volumes have to be related to the main events of DC Comics.

\- The volumes have to be available (not out of print or high prices).

\- The volumes have to be important for continuity (it is not worth it if they deal with forgotten characters or tell something irrelevant).

I will buy the ones that I need to start my reading challenge and then, I will start this fun project.

Thanks for your help!

DCcomics,[Comic Excerpt] Zatanna teaching Tim Hunter about Magic (The Books of Magic Vol 2 #41),False,24,0,"Books of Magic Volume 2 is about story of young magus Tim Hunter especially about his journey to learn about magic. Following his experience, Tim decides that what he needs is a mentor to teach him about magic and set off for America to find Zatanna.

Along the way, he reunites with his friend Molly. Tim take her to join Zatanna on tour and learn magic from her. After Zatanna make sure Tim already talking with his family after he is running away, Zee decided to adopt them as proteges.

In the page of issue 41 above, Zatanna wake up Tim in the morning to iniate his education. Zee showing a trick of making the sun appear with crystal ornament she brought at sales (I like Zee's snarkiness when teaching Tim). She manage to execute her tricks and making Tim puzzled on how Zee doing it especially without backward spell or any kind of magic. Zatanna said she would let him know if he come for breakfast first.

After Zatanna serving the breakfast for them, the obsessed Tim still curious about Zee earlier trick. Nevertheless Molly explain the trick to Tim in which Zatanna has reading the newspaper and observes when the sun would appear by checking her watch.

The issue is lovely for showing Zatanna care to the kids and how she let Tim to learn by himself first. It's also showcasing Zatanna observations of information and her surroundings then use it to her advantage. I kinda wish the book have more training sessions of Tim and Zatanna, even though if it's just a montage. Also shame DC is late on marketing their young boy Magician and got eclipsed by Harry Potter.

DCcomics,"General Continuity Timeline Question; Which Came First; the Formation of JL, or Batman’s Robin-Acquisition?",False,6,0,"Hi, DC Reddit. I’m currently working on a small side project, but seeing as I’m striving for “accuracy” (a term used very loosely when talking about the DC timeline), I wanted to know if some of you could help me out. It would be very appreciated.

I hope how I titled this post makes my question clear, but just in case: did the Justice League form before or after Bruce Wayne took in Dick Grayson/Robin’s debut? 

I’ve done some research into ages, and Bruce’s age depiction when he takes in Dick as his ward seems to be from 24-29 (while Dick’s seems to be 8-12), and I haven’t found a concrete source for Bruce’s age during JL’s formation. All I know is that the general consensus is that Robin comes along during year 3 for Batman, so my personal guess is Robin first, then JL? Only because 3 years of Batmanning seems a little too low before his time Justice-Leaguing. 

PLEASE be as “umm actually” as you want, cuz I genuinely want to be as close as I can be. Just don’t be mean or anything (let’s hope those aren’t famous last words).

I started another thread, asking for people to recommend DC-themed TV shows in general, and that's lead to some great discussion. In this second discussion, I have a more direct question. Over the years, there's been a number of live-action and animated Batman and Superman shows. I have questions about those two specifically.

Batman: This is a character I love enough to watch him in a TV series as opposed to a handful of movies. The Batman shows I'm familiar with is the 60's comedy, Birds of Prey, Gotham, and Pennyworth. From these, I love Gotham. From the animated shows, I watched the 90's animated series as a kid, and I think I watched some of Beyond. Which live-action shows would you recommend besides Gotham? Planning on getting Gotham on Blu-ray. From the animated shows, can I watch the ""Batman"" ones without committing to the overall DCAU?

Superman: This is the other DC character I like enough to watch him in a TV series. I liked Smallville back in the day, but lost touch around Season 3 or 4. I saw the opening episodes of Superman and Lois and liked what I saw. As a kid, I watched Lois &amp; Clark, but I dunno if I'd be able to enjoy it as an adult. Should I give Smallville and Superman and Lois a second chance? Are there other Superman shows, live-action or animated that you would recommend?

Clark Discovers his powers

John and Martha tell him that he's an alien 

someone important in Clark's life dies (this one is optional obviously but it happens sometimes, usually John)

Clark learns where he comes from and who is biological parents are

Clark gets his suit

Clark starts working at The Daily Planet

Clark starts using his powers to help people

Superman (or whatever he's called at this point) is confirmed to exist

He meets Lois

He's named ""Superman"" by the public and/or the press

He meets his Rogues Gallery

He meets Batman

He Meets Wonder Woman

He meets some of the other League Members

It was dark, edgy, colorful in character, serialized, gothic, and absolutely fantastic.

DCcomics,I Have A Question About Wonder Girl...,False,1,0,"Okay, so... 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's just say, hypothetically, there was to be a new DCAU timeline, one where the whole story is being rebuilt from the ground up. We come to Wonder Woman and the ever adjacent Wonder Girl. Now, my quandary may seem a touch... *unusual*, but, indulge me...

&amp;#x200B;

How beloved is Donna Troy's character? Would anyone care if she were omitted from a timeline where just about every other side character is being included at some point or another, and in her place, as Wonder Girl, Cassie would lead the way? I know Donna was one of the original members of the Teen Titans, and I love her design, but I'm having a difficult time justifying her existence, especially with certain... uh... *tweaks...* to Wonder Woman's origins. And beyond that, the simplest, most straight forward version of her origin that I can reasonably cobble together from the comics (baring I'm not forgetting any majorly important details) is basically ""she's kinda like Diana's evil clone/sister turned good"" which just sounds like a version of Kon El. On the other hand, if I like Donna so much, I could just give her Cassie's backstory and omit Cassie... but would that be slap in the face to Cassie's character? Or, how about I combine both characters? Or create a whole new character altogether? But then you lose *two* very iconic characters from an all-star lineup! All in all, it feels like whenever a Wonder Woman Brand character is being written, there's usually just so much bending over backward to justify their existence (although, you could probably apply that line of thought to most superhero families), and at the end of the day, I don't know what to do about it. I suppose I could always find a way for both characters to exist in this timeline... but it would mean radical changes to Donna specifically most likely. I'm primarily looking for fans' feelings on the characters in question, because at this point, I'm tempted to simply omit Donna and leave it at that. Your thoughts?",,7,,1,,public

DCcomics,How to Defeat Doomsday,False,1,0,"So I’m just spitballing an idea here but I think I have an idea to defeat Doomsday permanently without sending him to the end of time like we saw Superman do when he came back from the dead. If there’s any holes in my logic or something I’m forgetting let me know.

Doomsday’s power is not only super strength, durability, and poisonous spikes. Whenever he’s killed by something, he gets resurrected immune to whatever killed him in the first place. Brute strength, disintegration, even getting defeated by a horde of Kryptonians. So how do we kill him? We don’t. If he dies he’ll just resurrect immune to what we killed him with and we’ll have to start over again. To truly defeat him for good, we’d need to essentially trap him somewhere and make sure that there’s no possible way to escape. 

So there lies the question. How do we make a trap that no one can escape? First, let’s think about what drives him. Murder. The only thing that Doomsday knows how to do. Ever since his creation he’s just gone around the universe murdering people. So to stop him, we’d need to remove his desire to kill, which can be achieved with the Anti-Life equation. The only caveat being that the equation only works on sentient beings, and Doomsday may or may not be sentient depending on the continuity. If more protection is needed, you could potentially trap Doomsday in a mirror using mirror master’s technology, or Rocket’s inertia belt to establish a force field surrounding the mirror with a backup power supply just in case. And then for good measure place him on Mogo, where the sentient planet can keep him from leaving near indefinitely. 

What are you guys thoughts? Is there something I missed? Or what other ideas could be used to trap Doomsday permanently?",,4,,1,,public

What makes something canon? Doesn't the comic have to be met with ASTOUNDINGLY, PHENOMENALLY, POSITIVE, RAVE reviews for it to be considered canon? I'm pretty sure Snyder's ""The Court Of Owls"" storyline is canon cuz of how amazingly positive the reviews are for that arc. But from what I recall, The Three Jokers was met with mixed reviews but it's apparently connected to the main current ""Batman"" series right now.

Me personally, I've always liked the more sympathetic side of Batman, who is stoic but polite and respectful, has nothing but respect and admiration for the JLA and the Bat family and is allowed to have friends or lovers. Screw ""Batman is a tortuous loner"" and the fascistic Batman from Frank Miller, Bats sees the best in everyone and has a wide net of friends and allies around the world.

 On the other hand I also can't tolerate Batman being ""realistic"" or smn (Aka, being weak). I want Bruce to be highly effective, but not blatantly overpowered: Batman can break free of any trap or surpass any challenge, he can casually finance a worldwide superhero net like Batman Inc, he can heal from every wound or beat any foe. HOWEVER, he also can't casually solo the entire JLA, and he needs the Bat family to properly work as a superhero.

DCcomics,Too many people might not fully understand nature of Justice League,False,4,0,"Creators also must understand why JL is the only ""League"" in entire superhero genre, otherwise it will never be done right

This is the topic I'd like to discuss long ago. 
Most recent JL movie failed so badly and it got a lot of dramas behind it, it's over discussed so I won't talk about that again. 

However, what I want to address, is too many people, including a lot of writers, creators, might not truly understand the nature of Justice League. Justice League is never a simple superhero team. It's more complicated than that. There is a reason why it's called Justice ""LEAGUE"". 
People often compare JL with Avengers, consider them as equal. I dare to say that's the most misunderstanding in modern days.

Before I go further, let's talk about certain Marvel and DC teams. Avengers, X-Men, Teen Titans etc. Those are definitely some most famous and beloved teams in superhero comics. They might have different types of organizations, different team structures and scopes, but one thing is common, those are still just ""TEAMs"". What do I mean? What I mean is, these are fundamentally a structure about several superheroes form a line-up, work together to defeat certain big bad. You can easily see those teammates developed a friendship, a relationship, and a kind of family bond. 

It's basically like a sport team. You got great teammates, play the game together and spend a lot of time to form a bond. 

Okay, so what's the deal about Justice League? People might easily feel Justice League is also just several superheroes to form a team. Well, that's exactly why 2017's Justice League is fundamentally doomed because they got it all wrong. Justice League is never a team, it's an alliance, an organization, one united group with world's most important figures. It affects not only super villains, but the whole world's safety concern, politics concern and many many. It's the most powerful defense earth ever had, and it's not a place for friends but allies. Grant Morrison once said, Justice League is more like ""United Nations"".

Justice League always has a way more complicated history. Anyone has read comics know Justice League firstly debuts in silver age, a parallel universe to mirror JSA so Superman and Batman can be a part of it. It's also a time Superheroes especially DC Superheroes are not being serious. That's the ""Super-friend"" time. At that point it's no different from other superhero team, but today's Justice League, we have to go back to 90s. Grant Morrison's JLA is the archer of this organization. 

You see, traditional big seven is not random selected. They all represent the top of DC world. 

Superman-the most powerful being ever existed as well as the most influential superhero, even the center of DC Universe.

Batman- one of the richest, smartest human in earth, Wayne enterprise easily affects globally.

Wonder Woman- The princess of Amazons. Inheritance of old Gods. Recently She is even the daughter of Zeus, meaning she will one day inherit not only her island but possibly queen of old gods.

Aquaman- Already a King of Atlantis. He has the duty to connect both worlds. 

Green Lantern- no matter which human Green Lantern, they are the cops of galaxy. They can build an alliance between Lantern Corps and JL. 

Flash-Not special in terms of identity, but they connects one of the most important force in entire DC Universe. 

Martian Manhunter- The first ever alien alliance. (Superman identities himself more human than Kryptonian)

Now you see the deal? Those are the most influential people from each area. Big 7 has the power to shift not only earth but the whole universe's direction. That's why in Morrison's run, each meeting, each further expansion of league,big 7 will have to vote. That's why Batman fears Justice League's potential threat. 

So anyone wants to adapt Justice League, They can't threat JL like normal superhero team. It's definitely not. JL is more like alliance. From big seven to small heroes, it's the toughest organization affects each areas of the world",,5,,4,,public

DCcomics,The Joker is the worst current villain in DC,False,0,0,"I need to get this off my chest. DC doesn't know what the hell to do with the Joker. For the last ten odd years the only thing the Joker has done has been:

\- Trying to kill random people  
\- Destroy the Bat family or a member of the Bat family  
\- Poison people with his Joker toxin. 

Is that it? Where's the funny part? Where's the punchline? I don't want to get ""back in my day"" since I wasn't even alive then, but in the Joker's fish storyline, commonly agreed to be one of his best stories. He begins with a ridiculous plan to trademark fish with his face, and only gets violent when people don't take him seriously. Now, his plan is just ""Blow up weelchair bound orphans"" from the beginning. 

I guess DC is trying to capitalise of Heath Ledger and Joaquim Phoenix performance's, which were universally praised. HOWEVER, what worked on those movies doesn't translate to the comics. Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"", for example, takes place in a much more realistic universe, so it makes sense that the Joker is a terrorist. On the other hand, the DCU is full of psychic gorillas and tranvestite sentient streets, so the Joker should be allowed to be as surreal and quirky as possible (Besides, Heath's Joker also was very funny. ""Goodnight, ladies and gentlemen. We are tonight's entertainment \* Eats a shrimp \*)

Besides, the Joker is getting too much protagonism. It seems every Batman event that isn't about Gotham being taken over is about the Joker, to the degree it sometimes sounds like a clickbait title how bonkers his plot is (And not in a good bonkers way). **I TURNED THE ENTIRE JLA INTO JOKERS FOR 24 HOURS?

Despite obviously being very happy with his own Nightwing persona does Dick ever feel like he could've gone longer as Batman? Does it bother him a little that he had to let it go when he was just getting used to it? 

Has any comic addressed this in any way? I almost feel like he would feel a way about it specially considering him and Damian had such a fantastic dynamic and were building a solid reputation. Hard to believe he would be apathetic after such a transition.

DCcomics,New Wildcats Compendium.,False,10,0,"So, a true compendium is scheduled for July 2024.  The thing seems huge, almost 1000 pages, yet there is no list of collected issues.  The description reads:

&gt;Spinning from the pages of BATMAN comes the senses-shattering new series! The HALO Corporation has gathered a motley crew of operatives, led by Cole ""Grifter"" Cash, who are going to make the world a better place...no matter who they have to kill!  
&gt;  
&gt;Working in the shadows of the DC Universe, this new covert team has been tasked with gathering an elite group of scientists for the first phase of their plan…but the Cats’ mysterious leader, Void, might have other plans!

But the cover image is clearly from the very first issue, way before DC and Batman (TBF I never knew that it became a sort of ""Batman spin off"" under DC).

Few years ago I was dying to get its absolute, but the thing is so rare that people on ebay where asking for around $300 on it - insane in my opinion (and budget).

I would love to get this one, specially at the actual price ($39 at amazon), but without a clear list of collected issues I'm hesitating.  The problem is that just like Lobo this sure is not the final price but either a mistake or a hella launch discount (Lobo also had/still has a wrong description an no collected issues list).

DCcomics,Whatever happened to the confident superhero?,False,68,0,"Now don't get me wrong, heroes having doubts about things they've done is a great use of character and story.

But I'm talking more in the sense of identity. It seems like a lot of the younger generation (and even some of the older) are a lot less confident about literally everything. Tim Drake, Donna Troy, literally every Super with a series. Most times a lower tier hero in terms of popularity gets a mini, they end up going down some character redefining journey. You can bet that any time where they get a solo issue, youre gonna read: ""I'm some character and I've been defined as this and this. I've had my doubts, but now I know, I'm this.""

Sometimes, I want a story just about what the hero is doing. You need a status quo before the status quo can be shaken. Rather than day in the life issues that I love so much, it seems that these characters have to constantly be written strictly in character defining terms because they only get attention every once in a blue moon.

* [**Wesley Dodds: The Sandman**](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81oYe+PSm-L._SL1500_.jpg), by Robert Venditti, Riley Rossmo, and Ivan Plascencia

This month has seen the debut of three very promising JSA mini-series (*psst, JSA fans! You want DC to publish more JSA books?*), and I want to give a special shoutout to *Wesley Dodds: The Sandman*, a love letter to the original Golden Age Sandman and a throwback to classic 1930s street-level pulp heroes such as The Shadow and The Spider. By day, Wesley Dodds is an inventor, fighting against the technological progress of lethal warfare in the midst of World War II, and by night, he fights an innate evil within his city by putting his enemies to sleep.  

Riley Rossmo's stylized art may not be for everyone, but he imbues this book with a vibrant energy that captures the 1940s, and his dynamic layouts [just pop off the page](https://i.imgur.com/J0wTAdR.jpg). This comic is a cult hit in the making. Definitely give it a look.  

So, what are *you* reading?

I would've asked this on the Dark Knight's Main Sub but for some reason they don't allow Poll posts there, any ideas why BTW? (probably to avoid all of the ""whose the worst love interest"" posts but still)

also I know I likely don't need to give Thomas Wayne Batman any clarification since most people know where he's from (that know of him anyway) but I did it with everyone else so it's only fair

These are the rarest hair and eye colours in the world, but I feel like every second character has at least one of these. Added to the fact that this is usually set in America, obviously these combinations would be more common in some countries (Northern Europe mostly) but most of the characters that aren’t ""American white"" are pretty much the stereotype of their country.

**For those who don't know:** the way this works is that several comments will list this week’s releases, for any given title discussion you should respond to that comment. For example, *Wonder Woman* discussion would go in the replies to the ""Wonder Woman"" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too.

In other words, you should only be replying to other comments. If you have trouble understanding how to comment for a particular title, please refer to this [handy guide](http://i.imgur.com/NMABCqS.gif). Any unwarranted top level comments will be removed. 

Also, please refrain from posting short, low-content comments on threads for issues or episodes that have not yet been released. Put some effort to generate discussion. Instead of just posting ""So excited!"" or ""Best book!"", try something with a bit more substance, like ""Punchline is such an amazing character! Can't wait to see how they explore her in more depth in this issue.""

Another one might be with Mon El and Brainiac 5 since if Kara ends up joining the Legion of Superheroes she usually has one of these two as a love interest, so I thought that maybe in a world where Kara doesn't end up joining the legion, they could have a neat dynamic (whether it be as a couple or just good friends is honestly up to you, but if it's the latter for some reason I keep imagining something akin to Pike and Grog from Critical Role or the book Freak The Mighty)",,25,,4,,public

Just recently I’ve been reading the comics. I’ve read Miller’s Batman classics, The Long Halloween, All Star Superman, and a few other critically acclaimed ones. Also have read just a few misc. other ones, like The Joker War Saga. All of it ranged from good to really good for me, but nothing made me think “this is EXACTLY what I wanted, this is 100% up my alley.” At least, not until Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow. 

What I liked most was that it’s set as a companion telling the story of the hero, as opposed to third person or superhero POV. Ruthye being the POV was perfect for me. It let me view supergirl through a unique lens, and it was a great way to present the relationship between the two characters.

Meanwhile the Southern California Mite can run 353 body lengths per second, making it the fastest animal relative to its size.

Let's face it, comics can be confusing. No matter how big or small your question may be this is the place to ask and /r/DCcomics will do our best to answer it for you!

As the /r/DCcomics community continues to grow we are receiving an influx questions from readers of DC comics, or simply new readers to comics entirely. As Stan Lee has said, every comic book is someone's first, and even though he maybe be one of those [other guys](http://www.reddit.com/r/marvel) it certainly applies here as well. With this spirit in mind, these Q'n'A topics are intended to give those who may be puzzled a centralized place to connect with other knowledgable readers and clear up some confusion.

A new Ask the Veterans thread is posted every Sunday, and in the future answers to these questions will be organized into this subreddit's wiki page.

**To those answering**

Avoid vague replies like ""yes"" or ""no"". Rather do your best to explain your answer, and if necessary provide a link that may help anyone interested in learning more. Remember to &gt;!hide spoilers!&lt; when discussing major events that have taken place within one year of its release..

DCcomics,[discussion] why doesn't DC just make a whole new world that's similar to our own but without any of the stuff from the real world?,False,0,0,"I'm not just asking because of the cities (though those could be fuel to the fire honestly) but rather all the standin countries that are either specific countries or just standins for overall regions, like how Rhelasia is clearly meant to be Korea (at least in Young Justice) while Qurac is meant to be any generic Middle Eastern Country, much like what Santa Prisca is with Latin America. I get that they're often called the Justice League of America (sadly) but it still makes me wonder why they even have the real world at all with all these substitute countries, plus having this be a different world altogether would explain to morons like me why we don't see much of Superman stopping atrocities committed by Western Countries (though he's doing more of that now and I like it) I guess by making a vaguely US-like country in its place (like the Ferngill Republic in Stardew Valley)",,9,,0,,public

DCcomics,"[discussion] if you were to make a multiversally eclectic Justice League, who would be in it?",False,2,0,"no they wouldn't be coming together from across the multiverse, rather they'd be in a new universe where they all happen to coexist, obviously there'd be a few differences in their backstories so that they could fit better together in this new universe, but for the most part they're the same

also yes I know I asked this already, but I've developed the idea a bit more since then

First Roster: NGL I like to imagine this as just a natural extension of the current state of My Adventures With Superman since as of now there have now no other League members have shown up, I imagine they'd have the usual origins of a big threat happening and all of them coming together to combat it and then becoming an official team  
 

1. Mawsm Superman
2. Kirk Langstrom/Gods and Monsters Batman
3. Maria Mendoza/Wonder Woman in Stan Lee’s Just Imagine (also called Earth 6)
4. Jesse Quick/Earth 11 Flash (probably just called The Flash honestly)
5. Leonard Lewis/Just Imagine Green Lantern
6. Aquagirl (from Batman Beyond)
7. Starcop (from Earth 35)
8. The Olympian (also from Earth 35)
9. Alley Kat-Abra
10. Radman (from Earth 34)

&amp;#x200B;

Second round: I imagine the League would be some kind of special Task force formed and lead by President Ellis in this universe (also I honestly didn't know that Calvin Ellis and Thomas Wayne got together on different occasions, but I guess that's a testament to how well they fit together \^\^)

1. Calvin Ellis Superman
2. Thomas Wayne Batman
3. Bekka/Gods and Monsters Wonder Woman
4. Mary Maxwell/Just Imagine Flash
5. Gods and Monsters Green Lantern (nobody knows who they were meant to be)
6. Miss x (Earth 35)

Another option would be to keep some of the Earth GLs of your choice, and erase/reposition the rest of your choice.

Lastly, would be to just keep them all and find ways to consistently showcase all of them to satisfy their fanbases.

DCcomics,[DISCUSSION] Is Wonder Woman Bulletproof Or Not?,False,801,0,"From what I've looked into, the easy answer is, she is sometimes bulletproof. There have been a few stories I've looked into where she is bulletproof. But most of the time, it appears that she is not bulletproof. That's why she blocks bullets with her bracelets and shield. But it's not even bullets, it's anything that can penetrate her skin, so swords and any type of blade would count.

That just makes me think though, how does an alien like Superman, or any Kryptonian, or any alien or even super-human who is invulnerable to bullets and blades, why is it that these people are invulnerable to things like this? But someone like Wonder Woman. One of the STRONGEST memebers of the Justice League. A literal demigoddess. Created from somebody as powerful as Zeus, the King of Gods. An Amazon warrior who has beaten several INCREDIBLY powerful gods, aliens, and supervillains. How come Wonder Woman with all of these feats and powers, immortality included, can easily get injured and die from a simple 9mm bullet and/or knife?

DCcomics,What would your ideas for a DC “Ultimate Universe” be?,False,0,0,"I’ve been working on building out a hypothetical universe for an Ultimate DC, and I definitely want to hear everyone’s thoughts on what that would look like.

For what I’ve got written down so far, Superman starts his career at a younger age, at the age of 18, actually, and he bonds with a lot of the younger heroes as well, since he’s closer to their age than the leagues.

Bruce isn’t super different, his story is about him and dick taking on a vigilante version of the Joker. I’d say if I change him up at all….Damian will likely not be in this universe. I’ve been thinking it’ll be Duke or Carrie.

With flash..I’m conflicted. Wally is my favorite flash and I want him as the main flash (what I’ve gotten written for him was he was Kid Flash for about a year or 2 before Barry dies….leaving him as the flash at 15) but since Wally is the main flash in the comics….I’m thinking about keeping Barry as the flash. In my initial draft, Barry begins his career as the flash in his late 30’s, and Wally, who’s his son in this universe, follows in his footsteps. However If I make that change with Barry being the main flash he’ll possibly be a fairly young version of the character. But idk about having two justice leaguers as teenagers lmao

DCcomics,"What's the ""canon"" teen titans rosters and relationships for each robin?",False,5,0,"I'm a newer comic fan so I don't have the luxury of knowing the decades of history when it comes to comic knowledge. One of the harder things to track is the relationships of between characters. Some are easy like with the bat fam or justice league. However the teen titans and Robin's are impossible with how many iterations and retcons that follow those characters. Sometimes dick Grayson has the classic roster while other times it's Tim or damien that has the classic roster. Sometimes dick and speedy are besties while in others it's jason and speedy. So help me decipher this mystery so I know what the general consensus is.


Here's what I know so far:

Dick Grayson either has cyborg, Starfire, Raven, and beast boy or he has aqua lad (garth), wonder girl (donna), speedy, and kid flash (wally west). He is beties with wally and dates any red headed girl in his life. 

Jason doesn't have a titans team but is besties with speedy both are failed sidekicks I guess

Tim drake has superboy, impulse, wonder girl (cassie), and some how members of dick's titans even though they shouldn't be teens anymore. I think he dated cassie but stopped when he went crazy after batman died. 

Damien some how has anyone mentioned previously but also sometimes has a completely unique roster too. He also sometimes dates Raven and he was besties with Superman's kid until he was aged up for dumb reasons. R.i.p super sons comics",,16,,5,,public

DCcomics,What are your favorite DC movie/show ideas?,False,0,0,"TLDR: I came up with an idea for a movie based on Teen Titans, what are your show and movie ideas?

What are the ideas you have for a DC film or show, whether you think they're really good ideas or bad ones? What could the plot be about? Would it be an adaptation or just an original story (something you think has never before or hasn't been done enough)? Part of the DCEU or in its own universe?  I'd like to know what you guys have come up with because I think any concept can be pretty cool.

For me, this is an idea for a Teen Titans film I've had for a few years simply called, ""***Titans***"". It takes place in its universe separate from both the DCEU and the Titans show. I chose to keep it separate for more creative freedom and I personally feel should it not be obligated to connect it to the extended universe or the show really. For the tone, I'm thinking that it's more light with humor than most of the DCEU, but more dark and grounded than the MCU. It's also an origin story but not for how they got their powers or abilities, it's more how these particular heroes either banded together and/or were even recruited to be the new member of Titans along with some original team members. 

I've got no bio yet, but I have the basic plot summary and list of Titans my movie: Tim Drake/Robin, Raven, Beast Boy, Starfire, Cassie Sandsmark/Wonder Girl, Roy Harper/Red Arrow, and either a Cyborg villain Robert Zirrozinski (looking for redemption) or Cyborg himself (note: this idea was a time when Cyborg was in both Justice League and Doom Patrol a few years back), as they are either recruited to become part of or reviving the The Titans as they face off against the supervillains (not sure of their overall plans and goals) Professor Ivo, his androids Amazo and the army of similar models, Amazoids. Some of the previous Titans members appear either as cameos or supporting: Nightwing, Donna Troy/Troia, and technically both Starfire and Red Arrow were part of the original team before joining the new ones. They even appear along with the Justice League in the quick flashback opening sequence narrating about the League and how the Titans formed after it, and how it foreshadows new members joining.

DCcomics,The Justice League as horror film antagonists…?,False,0,0,"The Flash - Imagine being in a group of six, huddled up close together. Then, one of you suddenly vanishes, almost like instantly evaporating into thin air with a sweep of the wind! That’d be terrifying! 

Martian Manhunter - Can both read the minds of practically any organism on Earth alongside shapeshift. He could literally shapeshift into your greatest fear or into some abominable, gruesome, &amp; ghastly monster of nightmares…it’s scary either way! Not to even mention his advanced, telepathic abilities that could really mess with you when you don't know who or what's talking to you.

Superman - Whether day or night, he can see you ANYWHERE. He can smell your clothes/body odor from miles away, hear your very heartbeat, and determine your exact hiding location. Not even that, but when he does know, it won't take long for him to catch up. You should better hope to have even a grain of kryptonite on you should you care for your own life! 

Green Lantern - Could probably if not most definitely capable of creating some kind of horror/nightmare amusement park, the choices are virtually unending…

Cyborg - Could almost certainly conduct some creepy stalking, satellite tracking, and phone hijacking to the point of terrifying anyone…

Abyss - I LOVE the way this villain looks along with their name and I would not be opposed at all to eventually see this villain come back for one huge Batman arc.

DCcomics,"[Discussion] if you were in charge of making a new Justice League series, and given virtually complete creative freedom over it, how would you make it?",False,0,0,"personally I'd structure it like this: the first season would basically be all origin stories, it would be made up of 8 three-parters, seven of which would be focused on each of the seven founding members of the League (in this case it would be the OG Lineup, Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, Aquaman and Martian Manhunter) with the final three parter being about how they came together to form the Justice League. 

The final three parter would be structured more like a traditional movie, but the origins episodes would function a bit differently in terms of structure. 

The First episode of each of the Leaguers' origins would be from the point of view of the people they save (In particular I imagine Batman would save a bunch of teens in a group talking about who or what they think he is and us seeing their ideas like in ""Have I got a story for you"" from Gotham Knight and ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" in TAS, while Wonder Woman has been wandering the world since the end of WW2 like a Western hero and reveals herself to a town in South America) and once the episode's done everyone's like ""who are they!?"" and in the very next episode we learn just that. 

The second episode of each origin special would likely start with them alone in some way and eventually having them reminisce about their past in some way (usually by looking at something valuable to them, NGL the Batman one would probably be similar to when he gets home in the Lego Batman Movie, with it being all quiet at first and he's just doing whatever and then the music swells when he starts focusing on one of the pictures of his parents) and then of course we get their story. 

The final episode would likely be another thing of them in action but from their perspective this time, likely with something at the end that would eventually bring them all together. Lastly (like I said) the final three parter would basically be a big movie where the League finally forms (as to what threat they're facing in this version, I honestly don't know, maybe Darkseid, Maybe Brainiac, IDK)

Yes I know this is similar to Avengers: Earths Mightiest Heroes, I think it works",,4,,0,,public

One of them said they’d like a more streamlined universe that adapts the “arcs” into a cartoon(he wants the manga-anime pipeline).

DCcomics,"What to do with Supergirl as a character? (A conversation, and writing help for a fan fiction project)",False,2,0,"Supergirl is one of my favorite characters.  In fact, if I were to make a top 10 list of my favorite comic book characters, the #1 and #2 spots are always the same; Batman occupies the #1 spot by a wide margin, but the #2 spot is occupied by both Catwoman and Supergirl because I can't pick a favorite between those two characters-- I like them both for very different reasons.  The other eight spots on the list can change depending on my mood and other factors, but the #1 and #2 spots are always the same.

But sometimes with Supergirl, it seems like DC is just throwing stuff against the wall to see what sticks.  With Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and other characters, DC has found something that just 'works', but with Supergirl it seems like they are having trouble finding that 'groove' she fits into.  

Due to the popularity of the CW show (where Supergirl was essentially just Clark Kent/Superman) it does seem like some of the more recent Supergirl comics are taking her character in a similar direction, which is kinda disappointing.  I think a friend of mine phrased it best when he described the show by saying ""They took a character who should have a personality like Thor and gave her a personality like Peter Parker instead.""  

Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the CW show, I liked it for what it was, it entertained me, and that's all you can really ask for.  I watched about five seasons of the show (I think) so I definitely didn't hate it, but I'd like to see Supergirl become a more distinct character, and writing her to be more like Clark Kent/Superman will not accomplish that.  My favorite origin story for Supergirl was the one where she was taken to Themyscira to train with the Amazons.  At least I like that concept, anyway.  The execution of that concept wasn't great, I'd have liked a story that focused more on Supergirl's time on Themyscira.  If I were to write that story, maybe I'd give Kara a more timid personality that was a result of growing up on Krypton, and she'd become more like 'the god of thunder' after living with and training with the Amazons, but I'm just spitballing.  

Anyway, even if we go with the Amazon origin, that still leaves us with a question: what is Supergirl's 'thing'?  Or, the title of this post: ""What to do with Supergirl as a character?""

The reason I ask is that I am working on a DC Comics fan fiction project, and this is a question I have been grappling with lately, so I was hoping to get a conversation started with other fans of DC Comics, and maybe bounce some ideas off of people, and that sort of thing.  

My ideas thus far are to spend a little time focusing on Kara's life on Krypton in the last few weeks (or so) before its destruction-- which is something you couldn't really do with any other character except maybe General Zod.  After her escape pod is discovered, and she is released from it, Kara goes to Themyscira to train with the Amazons, and she will eventually become the adopted daughter of Queen Hippolyta, which (of course) makes Wonder Woman her adopted sister.  After Kara leaves Themyscira I'd like to see her become BFFs with Catwoman because a Supergirl/Catwoman crossover has something that's been on my 'wish list' as a fan for a long time now.  But I'm having trouble coming up with ideas about how to set Supergirl apart as a distinct character.  She has all the same powers Superman has, she has training similar to Wonder Woman, and hangs out with Catwoman, but what is Supergirl's 'thing'?  What is on your 'wish list' for the character, as a fan?  

Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this and engages in the conversation! :)",,11,,2,,public

DCcomics,[Fan-Made] Gods and Monsters Character ideas,False,0,0,"These are by no means established in a personally organized fan universe or anything, this is basically just me throwing things at the wall and seeing what sticks, so if anything seems contradictory, that's why

Hawk and Dove: two literal starcrossed lovers from Rann and Thanagar respectively (yes Hawk is from Rann and Dove is from Thanagar, I know that's odd but I think it's interesting that way)

Vigilante: Bruce Wayne takes up a persona similar to Zorro instead of becoming Batman, and he basically becomes a chivalrous, non-4th-wall-breaking version of Deadpool, giving speeches that even Beastwars Silverbolt would sigh to, kind of like Aquaman in Batman: The Brave and The Bold (honestly the idea of Bruce putting on this classical romantic vigilante persona is kind of sadder than what we get with him normally, considering how he's likely doing it as a means of coping with his parents' death) I can't take full credit for this one, I came up with Bruce being Vigilante but a friend of mine came up with the personality bit

Manbat: after the death of his son Bruce and his Wife Martha, Thomas Wayne falls into a deep depression that ends up taking a toll on his family's fortune, eventually leading to him taking up a life of drinking and gambling to cope with what happened that fateful night. Eventually though he decided to do something about the ""animals"" out there, inspired by the so called ""Batman"" who would eventually be one of the founding leaders of the Justice League, he dawned a costume of the same flying rodent (except in this case it's a lot more batlike with even a snout and fur and not just a silhouette thing) by day he's a professional wrestler, by night he's a crime fighting vigilante, and both are known by one name, Manbat (NGL this was mostly just a copy of the origins of Wayne Williams, Stan Lee's version of Batman in his Just Imagine series, but I think it makes sense, after all, if Batman in this universe has the actual DNA of a bat, then Manbat should be a guy dressed in a bat costume)

Terra: Diana ends up coming to life but she's still made of stone or clay (what she's made of depends y'know) and maybe gets cast out of Themyscira as a result? IDK, but regardless she's seen in the world of Man and is dubbed ""Terra"" by the media since she's basically a golem

Fire and Ice: AKA ""Green Inferno and Blue Blizzard"" two superpowered androids created by T.O Morrow, after the Fair Play incident, they left their creators lab and were found by the League (yeah not very detailed but I don't know a lot about Fire and Ice)

The Flash: Eobard Thawne is a scientist from the 25th century who is completely obsessed with the Speedforce, eventually learning how to harness it but accidentally sending himself back into the past

Plastic Man: either a Martian (TVtropes suggested a white Martian, I think that sounds neat) or is just the name of Metamorpho

Catwoman: probably Cheetah's name here (maybe she's a panther instead IDK) makes sense considering how Kirk Langstrom is Batman here

Supergirl: probably an origin similar to Conner/Superboy or just Kara as usual

How would you imagine Wonder Woman's villains as villains in a movie (they don't need to be the main antagonist if you think they can't fit the role, but they can be more secondary)?

Of course, we got Ares and Cheetah already as the obvious ones, and we got them recently. There is also Circe and Giganta might be known from the JL animated universe, but having them be the focus of a movie might be different. Medusa is another well-known Greek Mythology figure to be made into a villain. Tezcatlipoca is listed as a villain of hers if you want to explore other mythologies.

JL members swapping aesthetics but not names (Superman-Batman, Wonderwoman-Martian Manhunter and Flash-Green Lantern)

Kal El lands in ancient Persia and becomes Cyrus The Great

The Trinity swap what kind of ""terrestrial"" they are (Superman is an Extraterrestrial, Wonderwoman is an Ultraterrestrial and Batman is just a Terrestrial)

Superman joins The Blue Lantern Corps

Diana leaves Themyscira Early and travels the world, aiding many mythical and historical figures

a world where the Justice League and Legion of Doom swap public images (as heroes and villains) but not morality (for the most part anyway)

A Gods and Monsters style story in a different universe (like they fill the same niche and have the same aliases, but they're not the same people)

Superman lands in pre war Poland and fights Nazis

The Justice League begin in a Fallout and/or Mad Max style post apocalyptic setting

Krypton isn't destroyed and starts expanding its empire across the stars, Kal El is given control of Earth but joins their side against the Kryptonian Empire (I just described the plot of Dune didn't I?)

in a posthuman setting (ala Orion's Arm, with sapient AI, Animal Uplifts and Human Subspecies) The Legion of Superheroes is formed by young people inspired by the ancient works of DC comics

Captain Marvel but based around Norse Gods (I like to call it SHAZAM: Ragnarok)

Wonder Woman and Superman Swap roles (probably called ""Wonder Woman: Last Daughter of Krypton"" and ""Superman: Spirit of Hope"") and Superman is probably an Olympian god or Demigod

The Guardians of the Universe end up founding The Justice League or The Legion of Superheroes instead of The Green Lantern Corps (I like to call it League or Legion: In Brightest Day)

Tokusatsu Anime Superhero Justice League, I know this one has been imagined a lot (or at the very least anime versions) but I still think it could be really fun and provide a new flavor of campy \^\^

DCcomics,[Fan-Made] Changes I would personally make in my own DC Universe,False,0,0," 

before anyone asks, sorry about the random lack of organization

* J'onn is NB and wears a suit (like a business suit)
* the ""x"" on J’onn’s chest is actually a scar that always appears in some way no matter what form they take
* Bruce wears a full face mask as Batman (and so does the rest of the Batfam) and the Batsuit is more like Armor and is basically if Iron Man’s suit was more physics based instead of high tech (probably looks something like [**this**](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/e7/20/0d/e7200db4cd618e3cff1b6d8c0f74218d.jpg) [**this**](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1033134633166065776/1161400846924398632/ae1d52760da87de36dcdfa475d8e9af0.png?ex=65416453&amp;is=652eef53&amp;hm=a52a325db969e7377abc381f55b5ba3361b3ff811ad79737983493aea681c046&amp;=&amp;width=552&amp;height=982) or [**this**](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1033134633166065776/1161778315921719296/fuiyyljd9hya1.png?ex=6542c3df&amp;is=65304edf&amp;hm=aac54241f8371e4627a2ef03f8b9616d2a6b15dd09810824d0b0eff224dbbc33&amp;=&amp;width=682&amp;height=982))
* The Batsuit and the Batarangs are the only things Bruce Made to be explicitly Bat Themed, everything else was named either by the Public or Alfred
* The Utility Belt isn’t actually a belt and is built into the batsuit
* Diana's armor is white and gold 
* Clark's suit is a combination of a ceremonial garb of the House of El (the Blue part, probably originally looked like [**this**](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f6/fe/31/f6fe31dd3e0c248152473258993a96bb.jpg) but it was tightened in some way) and a few additions by John and Martha (the Cape, Boots and maybe red undies)
* Martha Kent was a member of Haly's circus which is why she made the additions she did (to make Clark look like a Strongman) also yes she did know Dick's Father
* Conner and Clark are a lot closer early on but Conner is still Clark's brother rather than his son 
* Clark has No Fingerprints
* The Fortress of Solitude Grew and/or was built by the ship that brought Clark to Earth
* Jon, Jordan and Chris likely all exist as Clark's sons 
* Brainiac and his ""siblings"" are all Kryptonian AIs and the predecessors of the Coluan Race
* the Daxamites are descendants of Kryptonians after Krypton was destroyed 
* most of the aliens look a let less human (Tamaraneans look like Cat People, Lobo is Death The Wolf's Alcoholic pervert brother, Thanagarians are Bird or Dinosaur People, Rannians are Space Elves and The New Gods all look different from eachother) Kryptonians are the only species that look exactly like us (also Cabby probably looks like a Tentacle Monster or Little Green Man while Mongul has Yak Horns)
* Gotham City's Crimerate is actually extremely low due to the exploits of Batman and the efforts of The Wayne Foundation, it just gets compared to cities like Detroit and Chicago because it's the playground of Larp loving Terrorists and Crime Bosses (the rogues)
* Captain Marvel's Name is actually SHAZAM while the wizard who gave him his powers is Merlin 
* SHAZAM's Acronym is different (likely a bit like [**this**](https://www.deviantart.com/darthdestruktor/art/Shazam-redesign-853105776))
* SHAZAM looks more elf-like like Black Adam
* SHAZAM/Billy Batson is a Trans Boy/Man (I feel like he's the easiest character to make trans)
* Clark is Ethnically Ambiguous
* Bruce is Half White Half Asian
* Diana has Olive Skin (she is Greek After All)
* Lara El was a Warrior and Guard for the House of El
* The Hive Five join the Titans
* Blue Kryptonite temporarily removes a Kryptonian’s Powers, Green Kryptonite poisons them (obviously), Gold Kryptonite overloads their powers to dangerous and unstable levels and Red Kryptonite’s effects are completely unpredictable
* Kryptonian nervous systems are different from ours and are the source of most of their powers. It projects a sort of “aura” around their body that allows them more control over it than we have over our own (so all those memes about sleep and irritable bowels we have here on earth are completely alien to Kryptonians) and this Aura is powered by energy that they absorb from Solar Radiation, and while the energy they got from their Sun Rao gave them more physical ability than us, the abilities that Clark gained from Earth’s Sun are amazing even by their standards (I mean he can fly after all)
* Jon’s Superhero name is Skyrocket
* Damian becomes Red X after being Robin
* Diana can’t fly, but she can leap tall buildings in a single bound 
* William Magnus’ research in nanotechnology (specifically with programming molecules) has been applied to nearly every industry, mostly Medicine and Manufacturing (it’s also one of the primary resources used by Cadmus)
* Krypton was destroyed just as it was trying to expand outside it’s solar system (that’s what Brainiac and his “siblings” were made for)
* Kara’s parents created a colonization ship (either a sleeper or generation ship) called the “Starship Argos” that was said to be en route to the Colu system, but in reality it was rerouted since Kara’s parents knew that Brainiac was up to no good much like Jor and Lara
* The Ship was eventually placed on the planet of Daxam, as well as the Bottled city of Kandor and eventually this led to the creation of the Daxamite culture
* Several different franchises and series are also included in this universe but modified to fit a bit better (kind of like Earth 27)
* Clark was diagnosed with Autism at a young age but really the symptoms of Autism are typical of Kryptonians
* Lana’s death was what caused Clark to go on his journey that lead to him discovering who he is
* Bill Dunn (protagonist of the short story “The Reign of The Superman”) is a childhood friend of Clark’s and likely fills the same role Lex does in some Smallville stories
* The Legion of Superheroes appear in a series of Comics Clark Grew up with due to a Time Paradox
* The Actual Legion is more diverse Species-Wise (the comics Clark Grew up with had them as Mostly Human to be more “relatable” to people at the time)
* The Legion was inspired by the whole Justice League, not just Superman
* Dick used to fill a sort of Oracle like role but he was also a hacker (Robin was the name of a character he made for an MMO) eventually though he took a combat role solo as Nightwing
* Oracle/Barbara eventually took over the assistance role of the League that Alfred once had
* Atlanteans look more like fish people and were the inspiration for HP Lovecraft’s Deep Ones (and Arthur’s aging was like theirs)
* Gorilla City is named something else",,3,,0,,public

DCcomics,Why can’t villains just be villains?,False,238,0,"I’m sick of the new trend that every well-liked villain must become some sort of anti-hero. In the last few years, it seems to have become a common theme that any popular antagonist will switch to becoming somewhat friendly with the protagonist at a certain point in the story. Obviously this isn’t just a problem in the DC universe but I would argue that it has one of the most severe cases when it comes down to a particular bat-wielding, white-faced sidekick. 

Harley Quinn has gone from being a full-blown psychotic, evil sidekick, who had sympathetic qualities but was still very much evil, to a quirky, friendly hero, who is best buds with the Bat Family and wants to do good in the world, despite still clearly being unstable. I understand that they wanted to promote a good message by having her leave her abuser, but her character motivations make no sense in recent projects and it’s clear that most of her scenes are used to please fans, with sassy one-liners and her getting on unrealistically well with everyone and their mother. Why should she keep the Harley Quinn alias at all if she is done with the joker? How is she stable enough to leave the relationship but still clearly insane in every other way?

Harley clearly doesn’t work as a hero, mainly because most of her character is being evil and unpredictable, and I wish that DC would just make her the evil sidekick again, or if they want some development, let her leave/kill the joker and become an bigger villain on her own, or even with Poison Ivy. Not every good character is moral and kind and I think we need to remember that a villain can still be compelling, sympathetic and even rooted for, without becoming a hero. ",,207,,238,,public

1. Expanding the Batman universe within the series, possibly introducing additional Batman-related characters like Nightwing, Robin, Batwoman, or Batwing to enrich the Gotham City narrative.

2. The potential for Bruce Wayne's reconciliation with Catwoman, offering an avenue for their complex relationship to deepen.

3. Delving deeper into Martian Manhunter's adaptation to the human world, exploring his experiences and interactions in the human realm.

4. The opportunity for more dedicated episodes featuring Batgirl and Supergirl, with a focus on their character development and unique challenges.

5. The consideration of Clark Kent and Wally West revealing their true identities to their partners, potentially leading to intriguing character dynamics and plotlines.

6. The spotlight on the growth and development of the friendships among Bruce Wayne, Clark Kent, and Diana Prince, emphasizing their camaraderie and collaborative efforts not romantically.

7. Expanding the presence of The Flash with additional episodes, showcasing his remarkable abilities and confrontations with formidable adversaries.

Finally I’m thinking about an idea of having a universe where the old/founding heroes (Clark,Bruce.Diana …)stayed dead or retired and the legacy heroes are the top ones. For the Justice league you could just have a mix of the young Justice,Titans and other generations. Dick being Batman, Wally : Flash, Two main Green Lanterns : Jessica and Kyle, Kaldur : Aquaman, Wonder Woman being Cassie, Green Arrow with Connor, Cyborg, Anissa Pierce : Black lighting, Miss Martian and Nathasha being steel. For Superman I’ll like to have both Conner as Superman and Kara. The others heroes like Roy, Donna, Kory … could be on other teams like the outsiders, birds of Prey, Batman incorporated ( for Tim), the outlaws or maybe an other new generation for the JSA. They could be some others surveying the Teen Titans Generation with Damian, Ace, Jon, Emiko, Bunker. Overall a new world opening new adventures.

Fear Inducement (Allows Batman to instil fear into anybody at will. Using this power batman can even make his opponents hallucinate and create terrifying illusions) Night inducement (allows batman to make areas in his vicinity night no matter the time) Flight, Night vision, Shadow manipulation (Batman will be able to disappear into the shadows, travel through them, replace parts of his body with shadows to become invulnerable on certain areas on his body, and even turn objects into shadows so then he carry them, kinda like hammer space, though the weight of those object will pile up onto Batman.) Technopathy (Batman can cause enemy machinery to malfunction and stop working, or even cause lights to flicker so he can disappear) Self sustenance (Batman will no longer have to eat, or sleep) Retrocognition, Atmokinesis (Batman could use this to control the weather in Gotham to make it rain, he can then sense every bodies presence who gets touched by the rain) Healing factor, Smoke transformation, Imperceptibility, enhanced physical and mental abilities

&gt;Nightwing

Camouflage, kinetic energy absorption, electricity manipulation, Advanced aerial movement, night vision, silent moving at night, gliding, advanced physical capabilities (I feel like as Robin he’d only have the camouflage and memetic energy absorption ability and as he greets older and becomes Nightwing he’d gain the other abilities)

&gt;Red Hood

Enhanced accuracy, regeneration, Enhanced physical abilities, Resurrection (before he gets resurrected I think he’d only have the enhanced accuracy, and a healing factor and when he gets brought back it mutates his powers turning his healing factor into regeneration, like Wolverine, and gaining the ability to resurrect himself. Though the resurrection would have a cool down)

&gt;Batgirl

Technopathy, Precognition, Enhanced physical capabilities, Freeze objects in time, Reverse time by 30 seconds, Flight, Retroactive healing ( she can reverse a part of her or another person’s body to past version reversing any possible wounds)

&gt;Red Robin

accelerated thought process, consecutive attacks against opponents become stronger. Consecutive attacks from enemies become weaker, retrocognition

DCcomics,[Discussion] Question about the tonal shift in DC Comics,False,6,0,"Hi everyone! I'm drafting a paper on the tonal change in DC comics from the Golden Age to the Modern Age. I typically only read Batgirl, Birds of Prey, and Robin (although I do read a few others when I can collect them), so I'm not as well-versed in the vast history of publications. From what I understand so far, a big part of the shift was Denny O'Neil's writing in the 70s and Frank Miller's writing in the 90s.

Crush (Xiomara Rojas) - The self proclaimed Main Boss, Crush is on a destructive path when she meets the others, reluctantly however she finds a home with the Teen Titans and learns that maybe the actions of her infamous father doesn’t define her, but that leaves her with the realization that she doesn’t know what what should define her.

DCcomics,[Discussion] The Problem with the Super Family,False,32,0,"As someone who loves DC's legacy characters, I appreciate all of their superhero families. I love the Super Family too and in concept, they work really well but they have a weird problem that's become very apparent after the current Action Comics run

The Super Family is too dependent on Superman. What I mean by that is every member of the Super Family has some sort of defined relationship with Superman but there is not a single other defined dynamic between the members (Maybe the Steels because they are family by blood) but in general, they don't have a solid dynamic that can be defined. I can't think of one legitimately interesting dynamic between two Super Family characters that doesn't involve Clark. This is not a problem with most of the other families. You have dynamics like Dick/Damian, Roy/Connor, Max/Bart, Donna/Cassie, Garth/Mera etc that exist without involving the primary, popular character. But for the Super Family, I feel like if you take out Superman, they are just a bunch of strangers

Part of this can be attributed to the fact that the second and third most popular members, Kara and Conner, have undergone several revisions that's made it impossible to create a defined dynamic between them but even after all these years, it's still a problem. Can anybody even define the dynamic between Jon and Conner or Jon and Kara etc? It's impossible to because it has barely been explored

I think the Super Family works in concept and it can easily work better if writers put some effort into actually creating some defined dynamics between the members instead of solely relying on Superman's relationships with all of them. That's the biggest problem behind the Super Family

Anyways thanks for reading. It just came to me a while ago and I thought I'd share it and see what people think about what I said",,15,,32,,public

i  just wanted to ask other people this as i find it fascinating but i  read somewhere that Manhunter and by extension all martian's have the potential to gain any and all superpowers due to their biomorphic structure which grants them the potential to mimic other peoples powers

so in theory they have the Potential to gain omnipotence or near to omnipotence as they could end up mimicing many powers over their lifetime

and i always wondered if manhunter could use his telekinesis to manipulate matter like say dr manhattan, firestorm and captain atom can? could manhunter control his cape like spawn can? as it is part of him due to his shapeshifting or could he make webs like spider-man?

so i was  wondering if there is any fact behind this or was it just some persons  theory i read somewhere as i am looking for any evidence that this  theory could be plausible or even true

With Brombal doing his first DC work as a part of the upcoming launch of *Green Lantern: Dark* as a part of the Elseworlds line, I figured it was worth checking out some more of his previous work. There's a lot of duality at work in this one: it runs with a plot device involving connections with both heaven and hell, it jumps back and forth between two time periods, and there are two lead characters. Brombal &amp; Robles manage to build out strong protagonists existing within an intriguing world that I wish they were able to explore within a full ongoing setting... but even this one short TPB that we get with it is highly appreciated, and I'm very glad I checked it out.

So, what are *you* reading?

DCcomics,Thoughts on Paul Levitz?,False,7,0,"What are your thoughts on the guy? I think DC was far more successful when he was VP under Jenette and later Prez and publisher. He knows business, is a wonderful writer (LEGION of Superheroes etc.) From a fan perspective, I really love him and he was a lot better for DC (IMO) than DiDio. 

That said, I have heard on CBR forums, and other forums, but cannot verify that he is kind of a prick personally, according to certain creators. I dunno if that's fair because I am not a comics pro and do not know about DC office politics or industry politics.

Apparently, there was an incident in an elevator between Levitz and Mark Millar that caused bad blood. And apparently Geoff Johns once got very mad at him for some reason involving Levitz shooting down an entire year's worth of  Johns' stories. Something else went down between him and DiDio before Dan took over. I don't know... what I think is, regardless of such hearsay, I like Levitz and really respect him for loving the medium and being really good to DC. What are your thoughts?

Waid gets these characters to a T and I love that he brings in so many disparate elements and makes them fit together. It feels like a DC Universe that anybody can get into. Old heads like me and younger readers and anybody can enjoy it and his storylines are so original.

DCcomics,Death really is the nicest of dc deities and isn't appreciated enough.,False,92,0,"When a mortal told her to try being on the receiving end for once and see how she would like it, she actually **did**. She made an effort, tried mortality for herself, and changed her behaviour out of pure compassion. And kept re-living as a mortal for a day every century ever since, just to see how it feels on our end.

Besides,

\&gt;you are a god

\&gt;your symbol of power is stolen by mortals

\&gt;kill them?

\&gt;punish them?

\&gt;smite them?

\&gt;sigh and purchase another trinket

Any other deity would have lost it and she just.... didn't. She really is amazing and isn't appreciated enough. DC seems a lot less bleak if you remember what it's Death is like.

Life in Gotham might be miserable and space horrors are deadly, but once it's over, it's over. And there is a friend to talk on the way.

- Predaplant's pick of the week: [*Wonder Woman* #2](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81qf4Lrk-mL.jpg)

**For those who don't know:** the way this works is that several comments will list this week’s releases, for any given title discussion you should respond to that comment. For example, *Wonder Woman* discussion would go in the replies to the ""Wonder Woman"" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too.

In other words, you should only be replying to other comments. If you have trouble understanding how to comment for a particular title, please refer to this [handy guide](http://i.imgur.com/NMABCqS.gif). Any unwarranted top level comments will be removed. 

Also, please refrain from posting short, low-content comments on threads for issues or episodes that have not yet been released. Put some effort to generate discussion. Instead of just posting ""So excited!"" or ""Best book!"", try something with a bit more substance, like ""Punchline is such an amazing character! Can't wait to see how they explore her in more depth in this issue.""

After he killed and tortured alot of heroes he became a tyrant of the world and alfred can't bear it anymore to see his beloved master bruce become this evil so he face bruce tell him this has gone to far and they go into a heated argument where bruce slaps alfred and telling him to leave before he does something that he wont regret so 
So Alfred leaves and forms resistance with the weakened heroes and villains to face the batfamily
Like with Superman in Apokolips war
My line up would maybe be 
Alfred,Red Hood,Ras al Ghul,Green Arrow,Harley Quinn,Clayface,Dr Freeze,Rose Wilson,Black Lightning
And to cut it short they charge the batfamily and Alfred goes shooting everyone and Finally Evil Tyrant Batman vs Resistance Leader Alfred Pennyworth",,3,,8,,public

Ganthet says this to Kyle, and since it's by Geoff Johns, one has to assume that there's a bigger picture here.

I feel like Travis Willingham would be perfect in the role of Captain Marvel/SHAZAM, especially since the sort of Greek Epic Hero voice would add to the absurdity of a 10 year old boy in the body of a borderline god acting like... a 10 year old boy, so basically how Grog is depicted in The Legend of Vox Machina except with him doing his Thor Voice (as to who would voice regular Billy, I don't know) I guess he'd also be good for Orion if he does his more serious voice (probably sounding like Heretic in Bad Blood)

I feel like Ashley Johnson would be good for Barbara Gordon, mostly since her voice already gives off a sort of rebellious teen vibe. She could also probably be good for Artemis (Green Arrow Artemis, not Wonder Woman Artemis) and maybe Stargirl 

Sam Riegel I think could be good for an older Beast Boy, and also maybe an Older Jon Kent (no I don't know why I think he'd work as Jon, I just do)

Matt would honestly be perfect for Metron or some other god like character as a bit of a meta thing, maybe Darkseid considering his role as Ganondorf in Tears of the Kingdom

DCcomics,Death and the maidens timeline,False,1,0,So just read batman and death and the maidens. For the most part I enjoyed it but one thing i was confused about was the timeline they set out in the book. Early on there’s a flashback to “2 years ago” in Paris. During it Nyssa and Ras speak and Nyssa claims it’s been 60 years (almost to the day) they last saw each other. By the end of the book the latest they’re confirmed interacting is in 1952. This would place the 2 years flashback in 2012 (1952 + 60 = 2012) and and the main story in 2014. This is really odd to me since the comic was published in 2004 and 2005. If they had said “50 years” it would place the main story in roughly present day of the time of publication. (1952 + 60 = 2002. 2002 + 2 = 2004) So why isn’t it 50? Does anyone know anything else about this? Is it a typo or something? I just don’t get why they’d have the comic set 10 years in the future on purpose. Anyone help me out?,,3,,1,,public

## Flossregularly's Rec of the Week:

* [**Wonder Woman**](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/AVIF_800250-T2/images/I/81sLJmB3AcL._SL1500_.jpg), by King and Sampere  

Don't be that person who just complains about panels of a comic you saw on twitter, read the comic! Love him or hate him, King is undeniably one of the most influential writers of the current era, and most of his stories end up enjoying some level of 'must read' status, even if they get their criticism as part of that acclaim.

And what's not controversial is Daniel Sampere art. It's real nice to look at.

So, what are *you* reading?

DCcomics,Are there any cities in DC that have extensive lore and history as Gotham?,False,3,0,"I mean Gotham history and lore is filled with macabre stories of crime, insanity and even the occult which gives the impression that Gotham is not just a normal city but a world of it's own that is separate from the rest of DC. It is also common knowledge that Gotham is sometimes less of a backdrop city but a character its own right that has its own traits and personality.

Metropolis is associated with Superman but the city does not have the same lore and history that befits its protector in that Metropolis would have long history  and stories of alien and science fiction phenomena before Superman's introduction

In this story the pit was created by refining a mystical elixr that Nezhas father used to revive him in back in Ancient China. Just recently the Gotham War storyline in the Batman series stated that the Lazarus Pit came from the meteor that gave Vandal Savage his powers. I find it weird that the writers contradict the origin in such close of a time period.  It makes it even more confusing that it was established back in the new 52 that the pits and vandals meteorite shared the chemical compound dionesium, giving evidence to support this origin.

DCcomics,What's something DC pushed for years but fans never cared for?,False,359,0,"What is something that DC tried to go with but just didn't click with fans?

Barbara Gordon being adopted is one major example I can think of. After the first Crisis, DC accidentally made James too young to be Babs' father, especially since he had a son in Batman: Year One. A workaround was that Babs is Jim's niece who he adopted when she was ten after her biological parents died.

Almost no Barbara Gordon fan I know treats this as a thing. I've only seen a few people say they prefer Babs being adopted, because they like the father/daughter relationship regardless of blood. 

This was canon from the late 80s to the early 2010s but it's a little known fact nevertheless. It was seldom mentioned in the comics. Adaptations *never* reference it. I have heard that a 2000s comic implied Babs was actually Jim's through cheating with his sister-in-law. The New 52 did away with it and now Babs is back to being Jim's bio daughter.",,427,,359,,public

DCcomics,"You know, I really like Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay.",False,4,0,"Though, to be fair, it's a little iffy with the resurrection of RF, but the amazing part of it and my all-time favorite ending of any movie ever is the death of Bronze Tiger who was really a good guy but he chose to funnel his grief into being an anti-hero. And surely, at the end of his life, he was likely to go to Hell, if Deadshot hadn't used the Get-out-of-Hell-free card, insuring Bronze Tiger would be able to reunite with his wife in Heaven. It has to be the best bittersweet ending to a movie I've seen in a while but not only does Deadshot follow it up with one of the best lines possible; ""Huh. Well I'll be damned."" (literally, of course, he's a Hitman/Mercenary) does one of if not my favorite scenes in the DCAU happen.

Huntress actually was in the movie so it feels weird to specifically exclude her, not to mention that she was on almost every iteration of the team prior.

DCcomics,[Character of the Month] Flex Mentallo,False,8,0,"## [Flex Mentallo](https://i.imgur.com/1gMyjdI.png)

**Created by:** Grant Morrison &amp; Richard Case

**First Appearance:** *Doom Patrol* (1987-1995) #35

**Affiliated Organizations:** Doom Patrol

**Strengths/Abilities:** Muscle Mystery (who needs anything else!?)

The Doom Patrol's famous Man of Muscle Mystery, Flex Mentallo first appeared in the beloved Grant Morrison &amp; Richard Case run of the series. Flex was a young man who filled out a mail-in coupon in order to gain access to a book. This wasn't just any book, however; it allowed Flex to gain the powers of Muscle Mystery, allowing him to control the very nature of reality through flexing his muscles!

Unfortunately, he ended up captured by a shadowy organization called the Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E. for years. He eventually escaped, but as an amnesiac, until the point where he was found and taken in by Danny the Street. When the Doom Patrol eventually visited Danny the Street, he regained his lost memories.

Taking on the Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E. with the help of the Doom Patrol, Flex learned that he was, in fact, a comic book character created by a man named Wally Sage, who had brought Flex to life with the power of his imagination. Upon the defeat of the Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E. and the death of Sage, Flex left the team, only returning to them decades later in the Young Animal series.

In that run, he once again inhabited Danny, helping out the team when necessary. He got a fun little story where he returned to his old beach to restore it to its former glory. He also appears in the recently concluded Unstoppable Doom Patrol series, and will presumably continue to appear if the series gets renewed for a second season as the creators have hinted may happen.

And why is he hyped as such a great hero? His combat strategies tend to just be ""Fly to someone while Berserking with your mace"", and it's not like his powers are that unique, nor is his lore. 

The only reason he is still used is because the Justice League cartoon had Hawkgirl. No writer short of Horatio could make Carter work, and DC should just anticlimatically kill him as cannon fodder for his next event, ""Crisis of Infinite Batmans: Multiversal Mayhem""",,140,,7,,public

* **Bat-Man of Gotham** \- arc immediately started after Failsafe. Don't know how many days or weeks this happened. But *Prime Earth* Gotham has rumors that Batman died already (Nightwing wore the Batman cowl once, on-panel). Batman seems to be missing maybe a week?

I wonder why Chip decided to put that many time jumps in his run, first two weeks then a big eight weeks (post-Knight Terrors or during ""Dawn of DC""). It's already quite hard to put a sensible Batman timeline - especially since we also have the Orghams in Ram V's Detective Comics - which so far don't have any, big ones at least (it entered ""Dawn"" with maybe 1070 or 1071). Then we also have other characters like Nightwing, Catwoman, Joker (or ""Joker"") running around - which also have their own ongoings and/or cameos (in Tec).",,15,,17,,public

DCcomics,"General Continuity Timeline Question; Which Came First; the Formation of JL, or Batman’s Robin-Acquisition?",False,4,0,"Hi, DC Reddit. I’m currently working on a small side project, but seeing as I’m striving for “accuracy” (a term used very loosely when talking about the DC timeline), I wanted to know if some of you could help me out. It would be very appreciated.

I hope how I titled this post makes my question clear, but just in case: did the Justice League form before or after Bruce Wayne took in Dick Grayson/Robin’s debut? 

I’ve done some research into ages, and Bruce’s age depiction when he takes in Dick as his ward seems to be from 24-29 (while Dick’s seems to be 8-12), and I haven’t found a concrete source for Bruce’s age during JL’s formation. All I know is that the general consensus is that Robin comes along during year 3 for Batman, so my personal guess is Robin first, then JL? Only because 3 years of Batmanning seems a little too low before his time Justice-Leaguing. 

PLEASE be as “umm actually” as you want, cuz I genuinely want to be as close as I can be. Just don’t be mean or anything (let’s hope those aren’t famous last words).

I started another thread, asking for people to recommend DC-themed TV shows in general, and that's lead to some great discussion. In this second discussion, I have a more direct question. Over the years, there's been a number of live-action and animated Batman and Superman shows. I have questions about those two specifically.

Batman: This is a character I love enough to watch him in a TV series as opposed to a handful of movies. The Batman shows I'm familiar with is the 60's comedy, Birds of Prey, Gotham, and Pennyworth. From these, I love Gotham. From the animated shows, I watched the 90's animated series as a kid, and I think I watched some of Beyond. Which live-action shows would you recommend besides Gotham? Planning on getting Gotham on Blu-ray. From the animated shows, can I watch the ""Batman"" ones without committing to the overall DCAU?

Superman: This is the other DC character I like enough to watch him in a TV series. I liked Smallville back in the day, but lost touch around Season 3 or 4. I saw the opening episodes of Superman and Lois and liked what I saw. As a kid, I watched Lois &amp; Clark, but I dunno if I'd be able to enjoy it as an adult. Should I give Smallville and Superman and Lois a second chance? Are there other Superman shows, live-action or animated that you would recommend?

Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's just say, hypothetically, there was to be a new DCAU timeline, one where the whole story is being rebuilt from the ground up. We come to Wonder Woman and the ever adjacent Wonder Girl. Now, my quandary may seem a touch... *unusual*, but, indulge me...

&amp;#x200B;

How beloved is Donna Troy's character? Would anyone care if she were omitted from a timeline where just about every other side character is being included at some point or another, and in her place, as Wonder Girl, Cassie would lead the way? I know Donna was one of the original members of the Teen Titans, and I love her design, but I'm having a difficult time justifying her existence, especially with certain... uh... *tweaks...* to Wonder Woman's origins. And beyond that, the simplest, most straight forward version of her origin that I can reasonably cobble together from the comics (baring I'm not forgetting any majorly important details) is basically ""she's kinda like Diana's evil clone/sister turned good"" which just sounds like a version of Kon El. On the other hand, if I like Donna so much, I could just give her Cassie's backstory and omit Cassie... but would that be slap in the face to Cassie's character? Or, how about I combine both characters? Or create a whole new character altogether? But then you lose *two* very iconic characters from an all-star lineup! All in all, it feels like whenever a Wonder Woman Brand character is being written, there's usually just so much bending over backward to justify their existence (although, you could probably apply that line of thought to most superhero families), and at the end of the day, I don't know what to do about it. I suppose I could always find a way for both characters to exist in this timeline... but it would mean radical changes to Donna specifically most likely. I'm primarily looking for fans' feelings on the characters in question, because at this point, I'm tempted to simply omit Donna and leave it at that. Your thoughts?",,7,,0,,public

DCcomics,How to Defeat Doomsday,False,2,0,"So I’m just spitballing an idea here but I think I have an idea to defeat Doomsday permanently without sending him to the end of time like we saw Superman do when he came back from the dead. If there’s any holes in my logic or something I’m forgetting let me know.

Doomsday’s power is not only super strength, durability, and poisonous spikes. Whenever he’s killed by something, he gets resurrected immune to whatever killed him in the first place. Brute strength, disintegration, even getting defeated by a horde of Kryptonians. So how do we kill him? We don’t. If he dies he’ll just resurrect immune to what we killed him with and we’ll have to start over again. To truly defeat him for good, we’d need to essentially trap him somewhere and make sure that there’s no possible way to escape. 

So there lies the question. How do we make a trap that no one can escape? First, let’s think about what drives him. Murder. The only thing that Doomsday knows how to do. Ever since his creation he’s just gone around the universe murdering people. So to stop him, we’d need to remove his desire to kill, which can be achieved with the Anti-Life equation. The only caveat being that the equation only works on sentient beings, and Doomsday may or may not be sentient depending on the continuity. If more protection is needed, you could potentially trap Doomsday in a mirror using mirror master’s technology, or Rocket’s inertia belt to establish a force field surrounding the mirror with a backup power supply just in case. And then for good measure place him on Mogo, where the sentient planet can keep him from leaving near indefinitely. 

What are you guys thoughts? Is there something I missed? Or what other ideas could be used to trap Doomsday permanently?",,4,,2,,public

I hope rec posts are allowed. But just as the title says, I'm  looking for Dick Grayson-centric stories that don't focus too much on who he is hooking up with. It's probably unavoidable, I will accept any of your recommendations, but I thought I would try. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am especially uninterested in his two main ships (Babs/Kori); no need to come defend them I totally get the attachment but they just do not interest me at all. 

I would be more open to things that avoid those two if that expands the recs if there happen to be any. I'm simply just more interested in the character beyond who he is sleeping with but he seems to get sort of reduced to relationship drama in my opinion...

DCcomics,What would be your ideal version of Batman?,False,6,0,"It seems every author has their own take on Batman. Sometimes Bruce Wayne is just an act, sometimes Batman just barely tolerated the JLA, sometimes he doesn't want nothing to do with Red Hood, sometimes he is willing to torture or cripple for information... What's your ideal version of the character?

Me personally, I've always liked the more sympathetic side of Batman, who is stoic but polite and respectful, has nothing but respect and admiration for the JLA and the Bat family and is allowed to have friends or lovers. Screw ""Batman is a tortuous loner"" and the fascistic Batman from Frank Miller, Bats sees the best in everyone and has a wide net of friends and allies around the world.

 On the other hand I also can't tolerate Batman being ""realistic"" or smn (Aka, being weak). I want Bruce to be highly effective, but not blatantly overpowered: Batman can break free of any trap or surpass any challenge, he can casually finance a worldwide superhero net like Batman Inc, he can heal from every wound or beat any foe. HOWEVER, he also can't casually solo the entire JLA, and he needs the Bat family to properly work as a superhero. 

In conclusion, the ideal Batman for me is as much of a boyscout as Captain Marvel or Superman, and an equally effective crimefighter.",,35,,6,,public

&gt;Spinning from the pages of BATMAN comes the senses-shattering new series! The HALO Corporation has gathered a motley crew of operatives, led by Cole ""Grifter"" Cash, who are going to make the world a better place...no matter who they have to kill!  
&gt;  
&gt;Working in the shadows of the DC Universe, this new covert team has been tasked with gathering an elite group of scientists for the first phase of their plan…but the Cats’ mysterious leader, Void, might have other plans!

But the cover image is clearly from the very first issue, way before DC and Batman (TBF I never knew that it became a sort of ""Batman spin off"" under DC).

Few years ago I was dying to get its absolute, but the thing is so rare that people on ebay where asking for around $300 on it - insane in my opinion (and budget).

I would love to get this one, specially at the actual price ($39 at amazon), but without a clear list of collected issues I'm hesitating.

DCcomics,Whatever happened to the confident superhero?,False,71,0,"Now don't get me wrong, heroes having doubts about things they've done is a great use of character and story.

But I'm talking more in the sense of identity. It seems like a lot of the younger generation (and even some of the older) are a lot less confident about literally everything. Tim Drake, Donna Troy, literally every Super with a series. Most times a lower tier hero in terms of popularity gets a mini, they end up going down some character redefining journey. You can bet that any time where they get a solo issue, youre gonna read: ""I'm some character and I've been defined as this and this. I've had my doubts, but now I know, I'm this.""

Sometimes, I want a story just about what the hero is doing. You need a status quo before the status quo can be shaken. Rather than day in the life issues that I love so much, it seems that these characters have to constantly be written strictly in character defining terms because they only get attention every once in a blue moon.

* [**Wesley Dodds: The Sandman**](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81oYe+PSm-L._SL1500_.jpg), by Robert Venditti, Riley Rossmo, and Ivan Plascencia

This month has seen the debut of three very promising JSA mini-series (*psst, JSA fans! You want DC to publish more JSA books?*), and I want to give a special shoutout to *Wesley Dodds: The Sandman*, a love letter to the original Golden Age Sandman and a throwback to classic 1930s street-level pulp heroes such as The Shadow and The Spider. By day, Wesley Dodds is an inventor, fighting against the technological progress of lethal warfare in the midst of World War II, and by night, he fights an innate evil within his city by putting his enemies to sleep.  

Riley Rossmo's stylized art may not be for everyone, but he imbues this book with a vibrant energy that captures the 1940s, and his dynamic layouts [just pop off the page](https://i.imgur.com/J0wTAdR.jpg). This comic is a cult hit in the making. Definitely give it a look.  

So, what are *you* reading?

**For those who don't know:** the way this works is that several comments will list this week’s releases, for any given title discussion you should respond to that comment. For example, *Wonder Woman* discussion would go in the replies to the ""Wonder Woman"" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too.

In other words, you should only be replying to other comments. If you have trouble understanding how to comment for a particular title, please refer to this [handy guide](http://i.imgur.com/NMABCqS.gif). Any unwarranted top level comments will be removed. 

Also, please refrain from posting short, low-content comments on threads for issues or episodes that have not yet been released. Put some effort to generate discussion. Instead of just posting ""So excited!"" or ""Best book!"", try something with a bit more substance, like ""Punchline is such an amazing character! Can't wait to see how they explore her in more depth in this issue.""

DCcomics,Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow is the first to really stick with me. What’s next?,False,43,0,"Hey guys! Always been a DC fan, but mostly via things like DCAU, Nolan’s movies, Injustice games, The Flashpoint Paradox movie etc. 

Just recently I’ve been reading the comics. I’ve read Miller’s Batman classics, The Long Halloween, All Star Superman, and a few other critically acclaimed ones. Also have read just a few misc. other ones, like The Joker War Saga. All of it ranged from good to really good for me, but nothing made me think “this is EXACTLY what I wanted, this is 100% up my alley.” At least, not until Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow. 

What I liked most was that it’s set as a companion telling the story of the hero, as opposed to third person or superhero POV. Ruthye being the POV was perfect for me. It let me view supergirl through a unique lens, and it was a great way to present the relationship between the two characters.

DCcomics,"[discussion] if you were to make a multiversally eclectic Justice League, who would be in it?",False,0,0,"no they wouldn't be coming together from across the multiverse, rather they'd be in a new universe where they all happen to coexist, obviously there'd be a few differences in their backstories so that they could fit better together in this new universe, but for the most part they're the same

also yes I know I asked this already, but I've developed the idea a bit more since then

First Roster: NGL I like to imagine this as just a natural extension of the current state of My Adventures With Superman since as of now there have now no other League members have shown up, I imagine they'd have the usual origins of a big threat happening and all of them coming together to combat it and then becoming an official team  
 

1. Mawsm Superman
2. Kirk Langstrom/Gods and Monsters Batman
3. Maria Mendoza/Wonder Woman in Stan Lee’s Just Imagine (also called Earth 6)
4. Jesse Quick/Earth 11 Flash (probably just called The Flash honestly)
5. Leonard Lewis/Just Imagine Green Lantern
6. Aquagirl (from Batman Beyond)
7. Starcop (from Earth 35)
8. The Olympian (also from Earth 35)
9. Alley Kat-Abra
10. Radman (from Earth 34)

&amp;#x200B;

Second round: I imagine the League would be some kind of special Task force formed and lead by President Ellis in this universe (also I honestly didn't know that Calvin Ellis and Thomas Wayne got together on different occasions, but I guess that's a testament to how well they fit together \^\^)

1. Calvin Ellis Superman
2. Thomas Wayne Batman
3. Bekka/Gods and Monsters Wonder Woman
4. Mary Maxwell/Just Imagine Flash
5. Gods and Monsters Green Lantern (nobody knows who they were meant to be)

DCcomics,[DISCUSSION] Is Wonder Woman Bulletproof Or Not?,False,804,0,"From what I've looked into, the easy answer is, she is sometimes bulletproof. There have been a few stories I've looked into where she is bulletproof. But most of the time, it appears that she is not bulletproof. That's why she blocks bullets with her bracelets and shield. But it's not even bullets, it's anything that can penetrate her skin, so swords and any type of blade would count.

That just makes me think though, how does an alien like Superman, or any Kryptonian, or any alien or even super-human who is invulnerable to bullets and blades, why is it that these people are invulnerable to things like this? But someone like Wonder Woman. One of the STRONGEST memebers of the Justice League. A literal demigoddess. Created from somebody as powerful as Zeus, the King of Gods. An Amazon warrior who has beaten several INCREDIBLY powerful gods, aliens, and supervillains. How come Wonder Woman with all of these feats and powers, immortality included, can easily get injured and die from a simple 9mm bullet and/or knife?

I was wondering that, because I was watching Smallville in its first season in the episode 3, and well the moment was that when the Coach Arnold was trying to convince Clark to join the football team, he said to him that Jonathan Kent was part of the football team when he studied in the high school adding that Clark has his genes, and Clark responds that he is adopted.

I have seen some old letter pages from the Knightfall era and many readers seemed to legit believe Azrael was the new lead but in that case DC was clever and made him the lead in most of the Batbbooks and made Bruce a secondary story.

I wish DC would keep the letter pages in their collections as they can really show how a fandom was pre-internet",,72,,210,,public

DCcomics,"What to do with Supergirl as a character? (A conversation, and writing help for a fan fiction project)",False,0,0,"Supergirl is one of my favorite characters.  In fact, if I were to make a top 10 list of my favorite comic book characters, the #1 and #2 spots are always the same; Batman occupies the #1 spot by a wide margin, but the #2 spot is occupied by both Catwoman and Supergirl because I can't pick a favorite between those two characters-- I like them both for very different reasons.  The other eight spots on the list can change depending on my mood and other factors, but the #1 and #2 spots are always the same.

But sometimes with Supergirl, it seems like DC is just throwing stuff against the wall to see what sticks.  With Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and other characters, DC has found something that just 'works', but with Supergirl it seems like they are having trouble finding that 'groove' she fits into.  

Due to the popularity of the CW show (where Supergirl was essentially just Clark Kent/Superman) it does seem like some of the more recent Supergirl comics are taking her character in a similar direction, which is kinda disappointing.  I think a friend of mine phrased it best when he described the show by saying ""They took a character who should have a personality like Thor and gave her a personality like Peter Parker instead.""  

Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the CW show, I liked it for what it was, it entertained me, and that's all you can really ask for.  I watched about five seasons of the show (I think) so I definitely didn't hate it, but I'd like to see Supergirl become a more distinct character, and writing her to be more like Clark Kent/Superman will not accomplish that.  My favorite origin story for Supergirl was the one where she was taken to Themyscira to train with the Amazons.  At least I like that concept, anyway.  The execution of that concept wasn't great, I'd have liked a story that focused more on Supergirl's time on Themyscira.  If I were to write that story, maybe I'd give Kara a more timid personality that was a result of growing up on Krypton, and she'd become more like 'the god of thunder' after living with and training with the Amazons, but I'm just spitballing.  

Anyway, even if we go with the Amazon origin, that still leaves us with a question: what is Supergirl's 'thing'?  Or, the title of this post: ""What to do with Supergirl as a character?""

The reason I ask is that I am working on a DC Comics fan fiction project, and this is a question I have been grappling with lately, so I was hoping to get a conversation started with other fans of DC Comics, and maybe bounce some ideas off of people, and that sort of thing.  

My ideas thus far are to spend a little time focusing on Kara's life on Krypton in the last few weeks (or so) before its destruction-- which is something you couldn't really do with any other character except maybe General Zod.  After her escape pod is discovered, and she is released from it, Kara goes to Themyscira to train with the Amazons, and she will eventually become the adopted daughter of Queen Hippolyta, which (of course) makes Wonder Woman her adopted sister.  After Kara leaves Themyscira I'd like to see her become BFFs with Catwoman because a Supergirl/Catwoman crossover has something that's been on my 'wish list' as a fan for a long time now.  But I'm having trouble coming up with ideas about how to set Supergirl apart as a distinct character.  She has all the same powers Superman has, she has training similar to Wonder Woman, and hangs out with Catwoman, but what is Supergirl's 'thing'?  What is on your 'wish list' for the character, as a fan?  

Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this and engages in the conversation! :)",,11,,0,,public

In comparison to the other Original Fab Five of the Teen Titans: Wonder Girl, Aqualad, Kid Flash, and Speedy, and other sidekicks like Supergirl and Batgirl, Robin is quite unique.

The other sidekicks resemble their mentors costumes and symbols and most even their mentors' color scheme. But Robin is completely separate from Batman.

Batman and Robin's color scheme and costume design is very different from one another. And unlike the other sidekicks, Robin has his own ""R"" symbol that sits on his left pectoral while Batman's symbol is that of a bat situated in the middle of his chest. The other sidekicks usually have a similar symbol to their mentors.

1. Expanding the Batman universe within the series, possibly introducing additional Batman-related characters like Nightwing, Robin, Batwoman, or Batwing to enrich the Gotham City narrative.

2. The potential for Bruce Wayne's reconciliation with Catwoman, offering an avenue for their complex relationship to deepen.

3. Delving deeper into Martian Manhunter's adaptation to the human world, exploring his experiences and interactions in the human realm.

4. The opportunity for more dedicated episodes featuring Batgirl and Supergirl, with a focus on their character development and unique challenges.

5. The consideration of Clark Kent and Wally West revealing their true identities to their partners, potentially leading to intriguing character dynamics and plotlines.

6. The spotlight on the growth and development of the friendships among Bruce Wayne, Clark Kent, and Diana Prince, emphasizing their camaraderie and collaborative efforts not romantically.

7. Expanding the presence of The Flash with additional episodes, showcasing his remarkable abilities and confrontations with formidable adversaries.

I also read the one re-printed volume of the original Kesel/Grummett run from the 90s, *Superboy: Trouble in Paradise*. I enjoyed all three of these.  

I did read the New 52 Superboy run back when it originally printed, and man, I did not like that version.

This is wrong on so many ends, perpetuated by fanon. For one, you already get a bunch of loving moments, and people need to start taking note rather than pretending it's never there.

Plus, keep in mind this is a family that has had multiple people try to kill the other, have lied to each other about dying, have different morals. 
People treat these characters as if they were made to be action figures to just pose with rather than characters having motivations.

Others examples are: ""Barry stole Wallys personality."" (he didnt). ""Hal Jordan has no personality, so why do they keep using him."" (he does) Any example of hating a comic that hasn't come out yet. (Remember Shazadam)",,92,,41,,public

DCcomics,Thoughts on Paul Levitz?,False,5,0,"What are your thoughts on the guy? I think DC was far more successful when he was VP under Jenette and later Prez and publisher. He knows business, is a wonderful writer (LEGION of Superheroes etc.) From a fan perspective, I really love him and he was a lot better for DC (IMO) than DiDio. 

That said, I have heard on CBR forums, and other forums, but cannot verify that he is kind of a prick personally, according to certain creators. I dunno if that's fair because I am not a comics pro and do not know about DC office politics or industry politics.

Apparently, there was an incident in an elevator between Levitz and Mark Millar that caused bad blood. And apparently Geoff Johns once got very mad at him for some reason involving Levitz shooting down an entire year's worth of  Johns' stories. Something else went down between him and DiDio before Dan took over. I don't know... what I think is, regardless of such hearsay, I like Levitz and really respect him for loving the medium and being really good to DC. What are your thoughts?

- Predaplant's pick of the week: [*Wonder Woman* #2](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81qf4Lrk-mL.jpg)

**For those who don't know:** the way this works is that several comments will list this week’s releases, for any given title discussion you should respond to that comment. For example, *Wonder Woman* discussion would go in the replies to the ""Wonder Woman"" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too.

In other words, you should only be replying to other comments. If you have trouble understanding how to comment for a particular title, please refer to this [handy guide](http://i.imgur.com/NMABCqS.gif). Any unwarranted top level comments will be removed. 

Also, please refrain from posting short, low-content comments on threads for issues or episodes that have not yet been released. Put some effort to generate discussion. Instead of just posting ""So excited!"" or ""Best book!"", try something with a bit more substance, like ""Punchline is such an amazing character! Can't wait to see how they explore her in more depth in this issue.""

After he killed and tortured alot of heroes he became a tyrant of the world and alfred can't bear it anymore to see his beloved master bruce become this evil so he face bruce tell him this has gone to far and they go into a heated argument where bruce slaps alfred and telling him to leave before he does something that he wont regret so 
So Alfred leaves and forms resistance with the weakened heroes and villains to face the batfamily
Like with Superman in Apokolips war
My line up would maybe be 
Alfred,Red Hood,Ras al Ghul,Green Arrow,Harley Quinn,Clayface,Dr Freeze,Rose Wilson,Black Lightning

Discussion of all books are welcome, whether they be DC, Marvel, Image, Boom!, Dark Horse, IDW, etc. You can discuss webcomics, manga, or even those mythical novels that don't have pictures in them.

## Flossregularly's Rec of the Week:

* [**Wonder Woman**](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/AVIF_800250-T2/images/I/81sLJmB3AcL._SL1500_.jpg), by King and Sampere  

Don't be that person who just complains about panels of a comic you saw on twitter, read the comic! Love him or hate him, King is undeniably one of the most influential writers of the current era, and most of his stories end up enjoying some level of 'must read' status, even if they get their criticism as part of that acclaim.

And what's not controversial is Daniel Sampere art. It's real nice to look at.

So, what are *you* reading?

DCcomics,Are there any cities in DC that have extensive lore and history as Gotham?,False,2,0,"I mean Gotham history and lore is filled with macabre stories of crime, insanity and even the occult which gives the impression that Gotham is not just a normal city but a world of it's own that is separate from the rest of DC. It is also common knowledge that Gotham is sometimes less of a backdrop city but a character its own right that has its own traits and personality.

Metropolis is associated with Superman but the city does not have the same lore and history that befits its protector in that Metropolis would have long history  and stories of alien and science fiction phenomena before Superman's introduction

I am curious does any city in DC Comics have extensive history and lore as Gotham because I have not seen much people discuss this.",,8,,2,,public

In this story the pit was created by refining a mystical elixr that Nezhas father used to revive him in back in Ancient China. Just recently the Gotham War storyline in the Batman series stated that the Lazarus Pit came from the meteor that gave Vandal Savage his powers. I find it weird that the writers contradict the origin in such close of a time period.  It makes it even more confusing that it was established back in the new 52 that the pits and vandals meteorite shared the chemical compound dionesium, giving evidence to support this origin.

DCcomics,What's something DC pushed for years but fans never cared for?,False,353,0,"What is something that DC tried to go with but just didn't click with fans?

Barbara Gordon being adopted is one major example I can think of. After the first Crisis, DC accidentally made James too young to be Babs' father, especially since he had a son in Batman: Year One. A workaround was that Babs is Jim's niece who he adopted when she was ten after her biological parents died.

Almost no Barbara Gordon fan I know treats this as a thing. I've only seen a few people say they prefer Babs being adopted, because they like the father/daughter relationship regardless of blood. 

This was canon from the late 80s to the early 2010s but it's a little known fact nevertheless. It was seldom mentioned in the comics. Adaptations *never* reference it. I have heard that a 2000s comic implied Babs was actually Jim's through cheating with his sister-in-law. The New 52 did away with it and now Babs is back to being Jim's bio daughter.",,427,,353,,public

DCcomics,"You know, I really like Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay.",False,3,0,"Though, to be fair, it's a little iffy with the resurrection of RF, but the amazing part of it and my all-time favorite ending of any movie ever is the death of Bronze Tiger who was really a good guy but he chose to funnel his grief into being an anti-hero. And surely, at the end of his life, he was likely to go to Hell, if Deadshot hadn't used the Get-out-of-Hell-free card, insuring Bronze Tiger would be able to reunite with his wife in Heaven. It has to be the best bittersweet ending to a movie I've seen in a while but not only does Deadshot follow it up with one of the best lines possible; ""Huh. Well I'll be damned."" (literally, of course, he's a Hitman/Mercenary) does one of if not my favorite scenes in the DCAU happen.

DCcomics,"[Cosplay] (self) Batman, classic blue and gray, real armor",False,105,0,"HIGHLIGHTS:

• Classic blue and gray color scheme as an homage to the DCAU and comics.

• 3D-printed temperature-resistant PETG cowl which I modeled to conform to my head. Nearly perfect vision and hearing even with white eye mesh. Perfect articulation due to two-piece design with balaclava underneath, and enough room built into the eyes to prevent discomfort from the mesh.

• Functional riot armor, able to withstand any non-ballistic attacks (not that I plan on doing any crime-fighting!). Plan to repaint a bit in the future.

• Magnetic holsters I built for the thigh guards which allow the attachment of three or four steel batarangs and a grapnel gun prop.

• Utility belt has several custom props, including a dispenser I built for harmless bang-snap explosives (basically tiny firecrackers). Also has a shard of ""kryptonite,"" a portable fan, power bank, flashlight/blacklight, metal prop handcuffs, lollipops (for Halloween, and for relaxing any young kiddos who get a little spooked), a small med-kit, and more.

• Several working gadgets secretly stored throughout the arms and legs of the costume, including multitools, a permanent marker, and a plasma arc lighter.

• T6 6061 aircraft aluminum forearm gauntlets with affixed cold steel plates to allow me to magnetically attach my smartphone. Commissioned those from a Canadian engineer on Etsy.

• Cape was made by a talented Ukrainian seamstress (also via Etsy) to fit my specifications for height, shape, color, and the added collar inspired by the design from Batman: White Knight.

• Molded PVC velcro patch bat symbol of my own design. Combines my favorite iterations.

• Equestrian half-chaps over tactical boots to provide the classic long-boot look without sacrificing comfort or ankle articulation.

And more.

Wish I had some better pictures, but haven't had many chances to bring it out yet.

Huntress actually was in the movie so it feels weird to specifically exclude her, not to mention that she was on almost every iteration of the team prior.

Let's face it, comics can be confusing. No matter how big or small your question may be this is the place to ask and /r/DCcomics will do our best to answer it for you!

As the /r/DCcomics community continues to grow we are receiving an influx questions from readers of DC comics, or simply new readers to comics entirely. As Stan Lee has said, every comic book is someone's first, and even though he maybe be one of those [other guys](http://www.reddit.com/r/marvel) it certainly applies here as well. With this spirit in mind, these Q'n'A topics are intended to give those who may be puzzled a centralized place to connect with other knowledgable readers and clear up some confusion.

A new Ask the Veterans thread is posted every Sunday, and in the future answers to these questions will be organized into this subreddit's wiki page.

**To those answering**

Avoid vague replies like ""yes"" or ""no"". Rather do your best to explain your answer, and if necessary provide a link that may help anyone interested in learning more. Remember to &gt;!hide spoilers!&lt; when discussing major events that have taken place within one year of its release..

DCcomics,Some basic ideas I had for potential mechanics/gameplay of this hypothetical AAA Superman game,False,5,0,"I was just wandering about the potential mechanics and trying to make it fun in my own mind, so I ended up falling in a significantly deeper rabbit hole than I originally anticipated and now I'm essentially torturing myself by going more in depth with the game that probably won't be made in a long time, so I might as well attempt to make some of yall suffer with me.

Metropolis being fully explorable is obviously a non brainer and now is the time better than ever to say definitively that it shouldn't be a problem to load with Supes' speed considering we're on the new system now. There should be options for other explorable sections, not nearly as detailed as Metropolis obviously, but Fortress of Solitude and Smallville are non brainers, Warworld, Apokolips, Brainiac's ship depending on who the main baddy you want for it, which we'll get to later.

Metropolis SHOULD look like unachievably futuristic and modern, I don't want it to look like any normal city, Gotham and Metropolis were always kind of the extremes, it'd feel wrong if neither were heavily modified to amplify the tone.

Another reason why I think utilizing multiple explorable worlds for Superman would be a good decision is because of a potentially most controversial topic when it comes to a Superman game, the complaint that Superman is just too OP for a game. I think in Metropolis after you beat the main story, you shouldn't be killable and you can just immerse yourself as this godlike being, but if you actually want a challenge after the main game, you go to somewhere else where there are also extremely powerful beings like yourself where you can in fact get damaged quite easily.

Now despite the fact that there are thousands of games where you can die to someone where that main character shouldn't possibly ever die to, you can't deny that there isn't something truly iconic about the big blue just slowly approaching the rain of bullets, every single one of them ricocheting off of him, that shit would just not get old for me, I remember in Lego Batman how fun it was that Superman literally couldn't be damaged, but that wouldn't make a fun game overall, so I think it's a smart move to secure Metropolis as the ""safe zone"" for when you beat all the main and side missions, and then you can leave Warworld as a combat wave place or something, I dunno.

I think it'd make a neat progression of the game to make like first 2 or 3 levels much smaller scale where Superman CAN'T REALLY BE directly hurt and implement some of those ideas of a city meter, or something similar, where too much destruction would cause death, but after that, as stronger villains get introduced, you'd need to start being careful cuz you could die fairly quickly.

Now realistically, if this WAS made, you'd probably expect it to be a trilogy, like the first game would be much more Metropolis centered with the main villain as Lex obviously, the second game could probably be Krypton centered with Brainiac, Zod and whatnot and then the final one could be Justice League connected with Darkseid as the big bad, but it's kind of reductive to pretend as if I'm inventing this new game from scratch, and immediately following up with a next game where I'd ""add some updates"", like it doesn't make sense, so we'll just pretend like that doesn't matter.

Obviously shoving all iconic Superman villains like Luthor, Brainiac, Zod, Doomsday etc. into a singular game would feel ridiculously cluttered, but it also feels like a disservice NOT to include them, so I'd like to see some of yours opinions on what should the general premise be. I was imagining something way more simple and linear, akin to Arkham Asylum, but obviously way grander and bigger. The charm of that game is that you can imagine it being one of the comics, but if also feels like a new universe, that kind of charm I'd like to see being replicated, where the history is already kind of implied, Lois would know who he is, characters like Steel or Supergirl would be implied as existent etc.

The thing I'm mostly excited about to discuss is the gameplay, let me preface this by saying I am in no way, shape or form experienced or familiar with the way this works, I literally just picked up a controller and imagined what I think would be fun to do, it was probably the biggest copium I've ever inhaled in my life, but take that aside.

Here's a shitty sketch of how buttons would operate:

https://preview.redd.it/mby5k66q3fyb1.png?width=1237&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03f050440bcc7ca815411abf2068b93d5168fb97

Square and Triangle would be your bread and butter for attacks, press square multiple times for the most basic ahh combo, once you grab an enemy type, you'd have a variety of different options to do something with them, whether it's to throw them at someone else, throw them into space, slam them against the ground or whatever.

In those moments, whenever you'd hold L2, you could choose where you'd throw the said enemy type.

If square is held, it's start a launcher, which sends enemies airborne, or airborne-er, since air combat is a no brainer and majority high level fights would be in the air anyway.

I think a genuinely VERY FUN game mechanic could be utilized with the Aim, so before you truly start kicking ass and connect multiple hits one after another and build your momentum, if you want to jump STRAIGHT INTO THE ACTION, if you hold L2 and THEN press square, he'd do his signature move that was pretty much cemented into every piece of media.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1580v2y/i\_love\_that\_this\_punch\_has\_become\_supermans\_thing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1580v2y/i_love_that_this_punch_has_become_supermans_thing/) is what I'm referencing to be specific.

If the aim was initiated and you pressed grab, I'd imagine Superman pretty much INSTANTLY going to the enemy and grabbing them, like I'm straight up talking whoosh, he's here. Describing it sounds so simple, but as I was imagining it, the amount of POWER you'd feel is the exact type of shit I am personally looking for.

Some string attacks I was imagining that could only serve as cool visuals, because as mechanically fun I want the game to be, the variety of animation is also important, that's why at no point does Batman in Arkham games feel repetitive in his combat despite you only having a single button. So if you were to launch someone while holding square and you'd press triangle, Clark would grab them by their leg and throw them into the direction you're subtly pointing towards, if the enemy is in that direction, it will automatically hit them, regardless of their elevation.

But offenses aside, you gotta have a defense, and for Superman I think a parry is most appropriate. DEFINITELY not a counter like for Batman, dodge is for Spider-Man (although he has a parry now too but ignore that) but I think a simple animation of Supes puffing his chest to deflect the hit fits quite well for the character.

X would be served for traversals. The moment you press it, Clark'd get off the ground and start levitating Minecraft creative style, if you hold the button, he'd go much faster in his iconic flying pose, but to the point where you could still appreciate the world around you. Double tapping and holding X would be used for whenever you'd essentially want to cross the entire map in literal seconds.

If you're on the ground and then you double tap, Clark would instantly fly couple of miles in the sky in a split second. The actual flying itself shouldn't be too difficult, you just fly wherever you're pointing towards with your left stick.

Super senses is... detective vision/spider sense, not the most pleasant way to describe it, but it's essentially the truth. I don't exactly know HOW would you differentiate it enough to the point where it doesn't feel too alienated from the powers Clark actually has, but also isn't literally just copy paste of those two mechanics, if anyone has a better idea, I'd love to hear it, let's say I'm just laying down the script so anyone potentially gets motivated to think of something better than I do.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/218m2muf7fyb1.png?width=952&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13ce8170a81a9e0d71937ece39953493b9daeb69

Aside from your health bar, you'd have the solar energy meter, which is basically used for Superman's iconic, more ranged superpowers. The higher you are, the faster it'd refill, if enemies have kryptonite, it'll refill slower. If the enemies posses magical powers, upon every hit, your solar energy would decrease just as much as your health would, if the red solar power is in area, it refills even slower.

The up,down,left,right buttons would just be a quick way to shift between your powers. You'd have heat vision, freeze breath, super breath and... tiny Superman jumping from your hand or something, we'll work on that, once again, someone can recommend the fourth ability, or maybe it doesn't need to be a fourth ability and you have another request that can fill the down button.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/60mwan3j8fyb1.png?width=946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=289916fde882295357d1df68d080b44f2d2769c4

L1 would be used to fire those said powers, by tapping it, you'd do slight attacks based on the purpose. If you tap heat vision, you'll send a decently damaging ranged attack.

If you tap super breath, you can push your enemies away if you're getting overwhelmed.

If you tap freezing breath, you slow down the enemies nearby you.

Freeze takes the least amount of solar energy, heat vision the most.

By holding L1, you'd use more of the meter as well as dealing more impactful blows. Heat vision would spawn a giant laser that would tear through everything in it's path. Super breath would suck every single enemy in the area, stunned, rendering them defenseless to hit them all in a single motion.

Freezing breath wouldn't just slow them down, but completely freeze them for couple of seconds, tougher enemies or bosses would only be slowed down though, I think it makes it fair seeing as how freeze would decrease the least of your meter, so it balances it out.

Ok this next idea I'm genuinely contemplating whether it'd be too broken or OP, you can help me decide.

Ignore the shitty MSPaint yellow ""glow"" which is meant to emulate the Sun, whenever your meter is full, you could active super speed, which would completely decrease your meter, but while it's leaking, EVERY SINGLE ENEMY TYPE would be completely frozen, and you'd gain a slight boost in speed as well. Everything around you would move warped, as if you're in water. Dust would be set in place, shock waves as you're punching someone etc.

https://preview.redd.it/hy9dfnrg9fyb1.png?width=922&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=492d9edc492f8a5c38f1f2a8e1f9e196684b76e3

Again, as much as I'm trying to make it fair and square, I also want the game to make you feel RIDICULOUSLY COOL, and this would do it for me certainly.

As for some of the side content, you could have a series of missions following Myx where he gives you a variety of trolling, reality warping missions until you somehow trick him by the end. These missions should fuck with you, reversed controls for one seems like an appropriate decision, maybe a section where you play a more toonified Portal, but instead of it being just two wormholes, you could physically pick up the hole and place it somewhere else for a neat little puzzle.

I think having missions where you're Clark Kent doing regular investigating could also be nice, more stealth oriented sections where you'd need to use your wit and powers subtly enough so that no one notices.

I think during these sections, a nice gameplay switch would be to change your established superpowers into three other ones, like changing his voice to make it sound like the guy you're trying to take down, or super hearing where you can gather extra information about an underworld organization or something. You could have a single main mission where that'd be set up, but it shouldn't be overdone in the main story.

Yeah that's mostly it, what do yall think, do you have ideas you think could work better to replace some of my own decisions, maybe some ideas that are just ADDING onto the skeleton I already established, like a combination of buttons to make him do a special move or something, I didn't want to get too into it, cuz once again, I don't know exactly how this type of combat is exactly supposed to operate.",,1,,5,,public

I wonder why Chip decided to put that many time jumps in his run, first two weeks then a big eight weeks (post-Knight Terrors or during ""Dawn of DC""). It's already quite hard to put a sensible Batman timeline - especially since we also have the Orghams in Ram V's Detective Comics - which so far don't have any, big ones at least (it entered ""Dawn"" with maybe 1070 or 1071). Then we also have other characters like Nightwing, Catwoman, Joker (or ""Joker"") running around - which also have their own ongoings and/or cameos (in Tec).",,15,,14,,public

Along the way, he reunites with his friend Molly. Tim take her to join Zatanna on tour and learn magic from her. After Zatanna make sure Tim already talking with his family after he is running away, Zee decided to adopt them as proteges.

In the page of issue 41 above, Zatanna wake up Tim in the morning to iniate his education. Zee showing a trick of making the sun appear with crystal ornament she brought at sales (I like Zee's snarkiness when teaching Tim). She manage to execute her tricks and making Tim puzzled on how Zee doing it especially without backward spell or any kind of magic. Zatanna said she would let him know if he come for breakfast first.

After Zatanna serving the breakfast for them, the obsessed Tim still curious about Zee earlier trick. Nevertheless Molly explain the trick to Tim in which Zatanna has reading the newspaper and observes when the sun would appear by checking her watch.

The issue is lovely for showing Zatanna care to the kids and how she let Tim to learn by himself first. It's also showcasing Zatanna observations of information and her surroundings then use it to her advantage. I kinda wish the book have more training sessions of Tim and Zatanna, even though if it's just a montage. Also shame DC is late on marketing their young boy Magician and got eclipsed by Harry Potter.

DCcomics,How to Defeat Doomsday,False,3,0,"So I’m just spitballing an idea here but I think I have an idea to defeat Doomsday permanently without sending him to the end of time like we saw Superman do when he came back from the dead. If there’s any holes in my logic or something I’m forgetting let me know.

Doomsday’s power is not only super strength, durability, and poisonous spikes. Whenever he’s killed by something, he gets resurrected immune to whatever killed him in the first place. Brute strength, disintegration, even getting defeated by a horde of Kryptonians. So how do we kill him? We don’t. If he dies he’ll just resurrect immune to what we killed him with and we’ll have to start over again. To truly defeat him for good, we’d need to essentially trap him somewhere and make sure that there’s no possible way to escape. 

So there lies the question. How do we make a trap that no one can escape? First, let’s think about what drives him. Murder. The only thing that Doomsday knows how to do. Ever since his creation he’s just gone around the universe murdering people. So to stop him, we’d need to remove his desire to kill, which can be achieved with the Anti-Life equation. The only caveat being that the equation only works on sentient beings, and Doomsday may or may not be sentient depending on the continuity. If more protection is needed, you could potentially trap Doomsday in a mirror using mirror master’s technology, or Rocket’s inertia belt to establish a force field surrounding the mirror with a backup power supply just in case. And then for good measure place him on Mogo, where the sentient planet can keep him from leaving near indefinitely. 

What are you guys thoughts? Is there something I missed? Or what other ideas could be used to trap Doomsday permanently?",,4,,3,,public

DCcomics,[DISCUSSION] Is The Three Jokers Canon?,False,160,0,"In one of Batman's newest comics, Batman says how he knows there are three Jokers, which obviously implies that Three Jokers is canon to the current ""Batman"" series. I'm pretty sure that ""The Joker: The Man Who Stopped Laughing"" is going to end with the last 2 of the 3 Jokers battling to the death, implying again that Three Jokers is canon.

What makes something canon? Doesn't the comic have to be met with ASTOUNDINGLY, PHENOMENALLY, POSITIVE, RAVE reviews for it to be considered canon? I'm pretty sure Snyder's ""The Court Of Owls"" storyline is canon cuz of how amazingly positive the reviews are for that arc. But from what I recall, The Three Jokers was met with mixed reviews but it's apparently connected to the main current ""Batman"" series right now.

I'm failry new to reading comics so how does something get considered canon or not?",,80,,160,,public

In that we see he struck a deal with Darkseid where he and Vandal will have an alliance until the galaxy is conquered and then they plan to slug it out until only one side is left standing. My question is if this is a one off thing because Darkseid found Vandal interesting or can he be bargained with? Because wouldn’t it make more sense to just go ahead and crush what could eventually become a threat? I was just really curious.,,4,,2,,public

But I'm talking more in the sense of identity. It seems like a lot of the younger generation (and even some of the older) are a lot less confident about literally everything. Tim Drake, Donna Troy, literally every Super with a series. Most times a lower tier hero in terms of popularity gets a mini, they end up going down some character redefining journey. You can bet that any time where they get a solo issue, youre gonna read: ""I'm some character and I've been defined as this and this. I've had my doubts, but now I know, I'm this.""

Sometimes, I want a story just about what the hero is doing. You need a status quo before the status quo can be shaken. Rather than day in the life issues that I love so much, it seems that these characters have to constantly be written strictly in character defining terms because they only get attention every once in a blue moon.

* [**Wesley Dodds: The Sandman**](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81oYe+PSm-L._SL1500_.jpg), by Robert Venditti, Riley Rossmo, and Ivan Plascencia

This month has seen the debut of three very promising JSA mini-series (*psst, JSA fans! You want DC to publish more JSA books?*), and I want to give a special shoutout to *Wesley Dodds: The Sandman*, a love letter to the original Golden Age Sandman and a throwback to classic 1930s street-level pulp heroes such as The Shadow and The Spider. By day, Wesley Dodds is an inventor, fighting against the technological progress of lethal warfare in the midst of World War II, and by night, he fights an innate evil within his city by putting his enemies to sleep.  

Riley Rossmo's stylized art may not be for everyone, but he imbues this book with a vibrant energy that captures the 1940s, and his dynamic layouts [just pop off the page](https://i.imgur.com/J0wTAdR.jpg). This comic is a cult hit in the making. Definitely give it a look.  

So, what are *you* reading?

Where does the JSA go into Limbo Fit? Alan was really in the closet for 60 years or something else going on with his marriage?

DCcomics,Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow is the first to really stick with me. What’s next?,False,46,0,"Hey guys! Always been a DC fan, but mostly via things like DCAU, Nolan’s movies, Injustice games, The Flashpoint Paradox movie etc. 

Just recently I’ve been reading the comics. I’ve read Miller’s Batman classics, The Long Halloween, All Star Superman, and a few other critically acclaimed ones. Also have read just a few misc. other ones, like The Joker War Saga. All of it ranged from good to really good for me, but nothing made me think “this is EXACTLY what I wanted, this is 100% up my alley.” At least, not until Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow. 

What I liked most was that it’s set as a companion telling the story of the hero, as opposed to third person or superhero POV. Ruthye being the POV was perfect for me. It let me view supergirl through a unique lens, and it was a great way to present the relationship between the two characters. 

Any recommendations based on the fact that Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow appealed to me over all of the above comics?",,15,,46,,public

DCcomics,"[discussion] if you were to make a multiversally eclectic Justice League, who would be in it?",False,3,0,"no they wouldn't be coming together from across the multiverse, rather they'd be in a new universe where they all happen to coexist, obviously there'd be a few differences in their backstories so that they could fit better together in this new universe, but for the most part they're the same

also yes I know I asked this already, but I've developed the idea a bit more since then

First Roster: NGL I like to imagine this as just a natural extension of the current state of My Adventures With Superman since as of now there have now no other League members have shown up, I imagine they'd have the usual origins of a big threat happening and all of them coming together to combat it and then becoming an official team  
 

1. Mawsm Superman
2. Kirk Langstrom/Gods and Monsters Batman
3. Maria Mendoza/Wonder Woman in Stan Lee’s Just Imagine (also called Earth 6)
4. Jesse Quick/Earth 11 Flash (probably just called The Flash honestly)
5. Leonard Lewis/Just Imagine Green Lantern
6. Aquagirl (from Batman Beyond)
7. Starcop (from Earth 35)
8. The Olympian (also from Earth 35)
9. Alley Kat-Abra
10. Radman (from Earth 34)

&amp;#x200B;

Second round: I imagine the League would be some kind of special Task force formed and lead by President Ellis in this universe (also I honestly didn't know that Calvin Ellis and Thomas Wayne got together on different occasions, but I guess that's a testament to how well they fit together \^\^)

1. Calvin Ellis Superman
2. Thomas Wayne Batman
3. Bekka/Gods and Monsters Wonder Woman
4. Mary Maxwell/Just Imagine Flash
5. Gods and Monsters Green Lantern (nobody knows who they were meant to be)
6. Miss x (Earth 35)
7. Mer-Man (Earth 36)",,7,,3,,public

DCcomics,[DISCUSSION] Is Wonder Woman Bulletproof Or Not?,False,798,0,"From what I've looked into, the easy answer is, she is sometimes bulletproof. There have been a few stories I've looked into where she is bulletproof. But most of the time, it appears that she is not bulletproof. That's why she blocks bullets with her bracelets and shield. But it's not even bullets, it's anything that can penetrate her skin, so swords and any type of blade would count.

That just makes me think though, how does an alien like Superman, or any Kryptonian, or any alien or even super-human who is invulnerable to bullets and blades, why is it that these people are invulnerable to things like this? But someone like Wonder Woman. One of the STRONGEST memebers of the Justice League. A literal demigoddess. Created from somebody as powerful as Zeus, the King of Gods. An Amazon warrior who has beaten several INCREDIBLY powerful gods, aliens, and supervillains. How come Wonder Woman with all of these feats and powers, immortality included, can easily get injured and die from a simple 9mm bullet and/or knife?

This is a genuine question, I love Wonder Woman. But this has always been something roaming in the back of my mind ever since I've learned how powerful she is.",,304,,798,,public

I was wondering that, because I was watching Smallville in its first season in the episode 3, and well the moment was that when the Coach Arnold was trying to convince Clark to join the football team, he said to him that Jonathan Kent was part of the football team when he studied in the high school adding that Clark has his genes, and Clark responds that he is adopted. And that moment raised me that question, since I never seen that before, and well there's some comics or other TV series that ever showed that Smallville or other close friends of Clark Knet know that he is adopted?",,34,,79,,public

DCcomics,"What's the ""canon"" teen titans rosters and relationships for each robin?",False,4,0,"I'm a newer comic fan so I don't have the luxury of knowing the decades of history when it comes to comic knowledge. One of the harder things to track is the relationships of between characters. Some are easy like with the bat fam or justice league. However the teen titans and Robin's are impossible with how many iterations and retcons that follow those characters. Sometimes dick Grayson has the classic roster while other times it's Tim or damien that has the classic roster. Sometimes dick and speedy are besties while in others it's jason and speedy. So help me decipher this mystery so I know what the general consensus is.


Here's what I know so far:

Dick Grayson either has cyborg, Starfire, Raven, and beast boy or he has aqua lad (garth), wonder girl (donna), speedy, and kid flash (wally west). He is beties with wally and dates any red headed girl in his life. 

Jason doesn't have a titans team but is besties with speedy both are failed sidekicks I guess

Tim drake has superboy, impulse, wonder girl (cassie), and some how members of dick's titans even though they shouldn't be teens anymore. I think he dated cassie but stopped when he went crazy after batman died. 

Damien some how has anyone mentioned previously but also sometimes has a completely unique roster too. He also sometimes dates Raven and he was besties with Superman's kid until he was aged up for dumb reasons. R.i.p super sons comics",,16,,4,,public

I have seen some old letter pages from the Knightfall era and many readers seemed to legit believe Azrael was the new lead but in that case DC was clever and made him the lead in most of the Batbbooks and made Bruce a secondary story.

Batman and Robin's color scheme and costume design is very different from one another.

DCcomics,[Fan-Made] Elseworld Ideas I had,False,3,0," 

Kal El becomes stranded in space before reaching Earth, and is found and raised by passing spacefarers

Dick and Bruce swap ages and roles but everything else about their backstories remain the same. So Dick's parents die and he becomes Batman, and then later on Crime Alley happens and Dick takes Bruce under his wing and he becomes Robin

JL members swapping aesthetics but not names (Superman-Batman, Wonderwoman-Martian Manhunter and Flash-Green Lantern)

Someone from the 31st century stumbles upon the ruins of The Batcave and takes on the mantle of Batman and joins the Legion of Superheroes

The Justice League IIINNNN SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE well more in space anyway. Superman is the last human, Batman is more or less the same just that he's an alien and Gotham is a crime ridden planet (think Nar Shadda from Star Wars) Wonder Woman is the heir to the throne of a race of isolationist insectoids (because queen) Flash can travel in Hyperspace (probably) and Brainiac probably fills the role of J'onn (not sure what GL would be)

a Just Imagine type series by another artist

Kal El lands in ancient Persia and becomes Cyrus The Great

The Trinity swap what kind of ""terrestrial"" they are (Superman is an Extraterrestrial, Wonderwoman is an Ultraterrestrial and Batman is just a Terrestrial)

Superman joins The Blue Lantern Corps

Diana leaves Themyscira Early and travels the world, aiding many mythical and historical figures

a world where the Justice League and Legion of Doom swap public images (as heroes and villains) but not morality (for the most part anyway)

A Gods and Monsters style story in a different universe (like they fill the same niche and have the same aliases, but they're not the same people)

The Regular Justice League but with all of their nationalities changed (except for maybe Superman, but for some reason I keep imagining him as Aussie)

Superman lands in pre war Poland and fights Nazis

The Justice League begin in a Fallout and/or Mad Max style post apocalyptic setting

Krypton isn't destroyed and starts expanding its empire across the stars, Kal El is given control of Earth but joins their side against the Kryptonian Empire (I just described the plot of Dune didn't I?)

in a posthuman setting (ala Orion's Arm, with sapient AI, Animal Uplifts and Human Subspecies) The Legion of Superheroes is formed by young people inspired by the ancient works of DC comics

Captain Marvel but based around Norse Gods (I like to call it SHAZAM: Ragnarok)

Wonder Woman and Superman Swap roles (probably called ""Wonder Woman: Last Daughter of Krypton"" and ""Superman: Spirit of Hope"") and Superman is probably an Olympian god or Demigod

The Guardians of the Universe end up founding The Justice League or The Legion of Superheroes instead of The Green Lantern Corps (I like to call it League or Legion: In Brightest Day)

Tokusatsu Anime Superhero Justice League, I know this one has been imagined a lot (or at the very least anime versions) but I still think it could be really fun and provide a new flavor of campy \^\^

The Justice League and Legion of Doom are two good and evil alien factions fighting on Earth (like Transformers) probably has notable nonpowered supporting characters like Lois, Jimmy, James Gordon, and others being in the usual supporting human role

Superman being the last Human who lands on a Zootopia-type anthro animal world

DCcomics,[Discussion] The Problem with the Super Family,False,31,0,"As someone who loves DC's legacy characters, I appreciate all of their superhero families. I love the Super Family too and in concept, they work really well but they have a weird problem that's become very apparent after the current Action Comics run

The Super Family is too dependent on Superman. What I mean by that is every member of the Super Family has some sort of defined relationship with Superman but there is not a single other defined dynamic between the members (Maybe the Steels because they are family by blood) but in general, they don't have a solid dynamic that can be defined. I can't think of one legitimately interesting dynamic between two Super Family characters that doesn't involve Clark. This is not a problem with most of the other families. You have dynamics like Dick/Damian, Roy/Connor, Max/Bart, Donna/Cassie, Garth/Mera etc that exist without involving the primary, popular character. But for the Super Family, I feel like if you take out Superman, they are just a bunch of strangers

Part of this can be attributed to the fact that the second and third most popular members, Kara and Conner, have undergone several revisions that's made it impossible to create a defined dynamic between them but even after all these years, it's still a problem. Can anybody even define the dynamic between Jon and Conner or Jon and Kara etc? It's impossible to because it has barely been explored

I think the Super Family works in concept and it can easily work better if writers put some effort into actually creating some defined dynamics between the members instead of solely relying on Superman's relationships with all of them. That's the biggest problem behind the Super Family

Anyways thanks for reading. It just came to me a while ago and I thought I'd share it and see what people think about what I said",,15,,31,,public

* [**Behold, Behemoth**](https://d28hgpri8am2if.cloudfront.net/book_images/onix/cvr9781684159109/behold-behemoth-9781684159109_hr.jpg), by Tate Brombal &amp; Nick Robles

With Brombal doing his first DC work as a part of the upcoming launch of *Green Lantern: Dark* as a part of the Elseworlds line, I figured it was worth checking out some more of his previous work. There's a lot of duality at work in this one: it runs with a plot device involving connections with both heaven and hell, it jumps back and forth between two time periods, and there are two lead characters. Brombal &amp; Robles manage to build out strong protagonists existing within an intriguing world that I wish they were able to explore within a full ongoing setting... but even this one short TPB that we get with it is highly appreciated, and I'm very glad I checked it out.

So, what are *you* reading?

But this new Batman/Superman thing? It's EVERYTHING DC COMICS SHOULD BE. Dan Mora's art is fantastic. His Batman is a mix of silver-age and bronze-age goodness and if you look at the way he draws him, there's hints of Batman'89 in the costume (OMG!) .

Waid gets these characters to a T and I love that he brings in so many disparate elements and makes them fit together. It feels like a DC Universe that anybody can get into. Old heads like me and younger readers and anybody can enjoy it and his storylines are so original. At times it feels like a perfect Justice League book but most of the time it's just Batman and Superman being exactly who they are.

I've been away from the DCU for about 13 years BUT It's the best thing I've read in years, including every indie book I've read since 2010.

DCcomics,What's something DC pushed for years but fans never cared for?,False,349,0,"What is something that DC tried to go with but just didn't click with fans?

Barbara Gordon being adopted is one major example I can think of. After the first Crisis, DC accidentally made James too young to be Babs' father, especially since he had a son in Batman: Year One. A workaround was that Babs is Jim's niece who he adopted when she was ten after her biological parents died.

Almost no Barbara Gordon fan I know treats this as a thing. I've only seen a few people say they prefer Babs being adopted, because they like the father/daughter relationship regardless of blood. 

This was canon from the late 80s to the early 2010s but it's a little known fact nevertheless. It was seldom mentioned in the comics. Adaptations *never* reference it. I have heard that a 2000s comic implied Babs was actually Jim's through cheating with his sister-in-law. The New 52 did away with it and now Babs is back to being Jim's bio daughter.",,427,,349,,public

• 3D-printed temperature-resistant PETG cowl which I modeled to conform to my head. Nearly perfect vision and hearing even with white eye mesh. Perfect articulation due to two-piece design with balaclava underneath, and enough room built into the eyes to prevent discomfort from the mesh.

• Functional riot armor, able to withstand any non-ballistic attacks (not that I plan on doing any crime-fighting!). Plan to repaint a bit in the future.

• Magnetic holsters I built for the thigh guards which allow the attachment of three or four steel batarangs and a grapnel gun prop.

• Utility belt has several custom props, including a dispenser I built for harmless bang-snap explosives (basically tiny firecrackers). Also has a shard of ""kryptonite,"" a portable fan, power bank, flashlight/blacklight, metal prop handcuffs, lollipops (for Halloween, and for relaxing any young kiddos who get a little spooked), a small med-kit, and more.

• Several working gadgets secretly stored throughout the arms and legs of the costume, including multitools, a permanent marker, and a plasma arc lighter.

• T6 6061 aircraft aluminum forearm gauntlets with affixed cold steel plates to allow me to magnetically attach my smartphone. Commissioned those from a Canadian engineer on Etsy.

• Cape was made by a talented Ukrainian seamstress (also via Etsy) to fit my specifications for height, shape, color, and the added collar inspired by the design from Batman: White Knight.

• Molded PVC velcro patch bat symbol of my own design. Combines my favorite iterations.

• Equestrian half-chaps over tactical boots to provide the classic long-boot look without sacrificing comfort or ankle articulation.

DCcomics,[Character of the Month] Flex Mentallo,False,10,0,"## [Flex Mentallo](https://i.imgur.com/1gMyjdI.png)

**Created by:** Grant Morrison &amp; Richard Case

**First Appearance:** *Doom Patrol* (1987-1995) #35

**Affiliated Organizations:** Doom Patrol

**Strengths/Abilities:** Muscle Mystery (who needs anything else!?)

The Doom Patrol's famous Man of Muscle Mystery, Flex Mentallo first appeared in the beloved Grant Morrison &amp; Richard Case run of the series. Flex was a young man who filled out a mail-in coupon in order to gain access to a book. This wasn't just any book, however; it allowed Flex to gain the powers of Muscle Mystery, allowing him to control the very nature of reality through flexing his muscles!

Unfortunately, he ended up captured by a shadowy organization called the Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E. for years. He eventually escaped, but as an amnesiac, until the point where he was found and taken in by Danny the Street. When the Doom Patrol eventually visited Danny the Street, he regained his lost memories.

Taking on the Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E. with the help of the Doom Patrol, Flex learned that he was, in fact, a comic book character created by a man named Wally Sage, who had brought Flex to life with the power of his imagination. Upon the defeat of the Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E. and the death of Sage, Flex left the team, only returning to them decades later in the Young Animal series.

In that run, he once again inhabited Danny, helping out the team when necessary. He got a fun little story where he returned to his old beach to restore it to its former glory. He also appears in the recently concluded Unstoppable Doom Patrol series, and will presumably continue to appear if the series gets renewed for a second season as the creators have hinted may happen.

And why is he hyped as such a great hero? His combat strategies tend to just be ""Fly to someone while Berserking with your mace"", and it's not like his powers are that unique, nor is his lore. 

The only reason he is still used is because the Justice League cartoon had Hawkgirl. No writer short of Horatio could make Carter work, and DC should just anticlimatically kill him as cannon fodder for his next event, ""Crisis of Infinite Batmans: Multiversal Mayhem""",,140,,10,,public

Let's face it, comics can be confusing. No matter how big or small your question may be this is the place to ask and /r/DCcomics will do our best to answer it for you!

As the /r/DCcomics community continues to grow we are receiving an influx questions from readers of DC comics, or simply new readers to comics entirely. As Stan Lee has said, every comic book is someone's first, and even though he maybe be one of those [other guys](http://www.reddit.com/r/marvel) it certainly applies here as well. With this spirit in mind, these Q'n'A topics are intended to give those who may be puzzled a centralized place to connect with other knowledgable readers and clear up some confusion.

A new Ask the Veterans thread is posted every Sunday, and in the future answers to these questions will be organized into this subreddit's wiki page.

DCcomics,Some basic ideas I had for potential mechanics/gameplay of this hypothetical AAA Superman game,False,4,0,"I was just wandering about the potential mechanics and trying to make it fun in my own mind, so I ended up falling in a significantly deeper rabbit hole than I originally anticipated and now I'm essentially torturing myself by going more in depth with the game that probably won't be made in a long time, so I might as well attempt to make some of yall suffer with me.

Metropolis being fully explorable is obviously a non brainer and now is the time better than ever to say definitively that it shouldn't be a problem to load with Supes' speed considering we're on the new system now. There should be options for other explorable sections, not nearly as detailed as Metropolis obviously, but Fortress of Solitude and Smallville are non brainers, Warworld, Apokolips, Brainiac's ship depending on who the main baddy you want for it, which we'll get to later.

Metropolis SHOULD look like unachievably futuristic and modern, I don't want it to look like any normal city, Gotham and Metropolis were always kind of the extremes, it'd feel wrong if neither were heavily modified to amplify the tone.

Another reason why I think utilizing multiple explorable worlds for Superman would be a good decision is because of a potentially most controversial topic when it comes to a Superman game, the complaint that Superman is just too OP for a game. I think in Metropolis after you beat the main story, you shouldn't be killable and you can just immerse yourself as this godlike being, but if you actually want a challenge after the main game, you go to somewhere else where there are also extremely powerful beings like yourself where you can in fact get damaged quite easily.

Now despite the fact that there are thousands of games where you can die to someone where that main character shouldn't possibly ever die to, you can't deny that there isn't something truly iconic about the big blue just slowly approaching the rain of bullets, every single one of them ricocheting off of him, that shit would just not get old for me, I remember in Lego Batman how fun it was that Superman literally couldn't be damaged, but that wouldn't make a fun game overall, so I think it's a smart move to secure Metropolis as the ""safe zone"" for when you beat all the main and side missions, and then you can leave Warworld as a combat wave place or something, I dunno.

I think it'd make a neat progression of the game to make like first 2 or 3 levels much smaller scale where Superman CAN'T REALLY BE directly hurt and implement some of those ideas of a city meter, or something similar, where too much destruction would cause death, but after that, as stronger villains get introduced, you'd need to start being careful cuz you could die fairly quickly.

Now realistically, if this WAS made, you'd probably expect it to be a trilogy, like the first game would be much more Metropolis centered with the main villain as Lex obviously, the second game could probably be Krypton centered with Brainiac, Zod and whatnot and then the final one could be Justice League connected with Darkseid as the big bad, but it's kind of reductive to pretend as if I'm inventing this new game from scratch, and immediately following up with a next game where I'd ""add some updates"", like it doesn't make sense, so we'll just pretend like that doesn't matter.

Obviously shoving all iconic Superman villains like Luthor, Brainiac, Zod, Doomsday etc. into a singular game would feel ridiculously cluttered, but it also feels like a disservice NOT to include them, so I'd like to see some of yours opinions on what should the general premise be. I was imagining something way more simple and linear, akin to Arkham Asylum, but obviously way grander and bigger. The charm of that game is that you can imagine it being one of the comics, but if also feels like a new universe, that kind of charm I'd like to see being replicated, where the history is already kind of implied, Lois would know who he is, characters like Steel or Supergirl would be implied as existent etc.

The thing I'm mostly excited about to discuss is the gameplay, let me preface this by saying I am in no way, shape or form experienced or familiar with the way this works, I literally just picked up a controller and imagined what I think would be fun to do, it was probably the biggest copium I've ever inhaled in my life, but take that aside.

Here's a shitty sketch of how buttons would operate:

https://preview.redd.it/mby5k66q3fyb1.png?width=1237&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03f050440bcc7ca815411abf2068b93d5168fb97

Square and Triangle would be your bread and butter for attacks, press square multiple times for the most basic ahh combo, once you grab an enemy type, you'd have a variety of different options to do something with them, whether it's to throw them at someone else, throw them into space, slam them against the ground or whatever.

In those moments, whenever you'd hold L2, you could choose where you'd throw the said enemy type.

If square is held, it's start a launcher, which sends enemies airborne, or airborne-er, since air combat is a no brainer and majority high level fights would be in the air anyway.

I think a genuinely VERY FUN game mechanic could be utilized with the Aim, so before you truly start kicking ass and connect multiple hits one after another and build your momentum, if you want to jump STRAIGHT INTO THE ACTION, if you hold L2 and THEN press square, he'd do his signature move that was pretty much cemented into every piece of media.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1580v2y/i\_love\_that\_this\_punch\_has\_become\_supermans\_thing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1580v2y/i_love_that_this_punch_has_become_supermans_thing/) is what I'm referencing to be specific.

If the aim was initiated and you pressed grab, I'd imagine Superman pretty much INSTANTLY going to the enemy and grabbing them, like I'm straight up talking whoosh, he's here. Describing it sounds so simple, but as I was imagining it, the amount of POWER you'd feel is the exact type of shit I am personally looking for.

Some string attacks I was imagining that could only serve as cool visuals, because as mechanically fun I want the game to be, the variety of animation is also important, that's why at no point does Batman in Arkham games feel repetitive in his combat despite you only having a single button. So if you were to launch someone while holding square and you'd press triangle, Clark would grab them by their leg and throw them into the direction you're subtly pointing towards, if the enemy is in that direction, it will automatically hit them, regardless of their elevation.

But offenses aside, you gotta have a defense, and for Superman I think a parry is most appropriate. DEFINITELY not a counter like for Batman, dodge is for Spider-Man (although he has a parry now too but ignore that) but I think a simple animation of Supes puffing his chest to deflect the hit fits quite well for the character.

X would be served for traversals. The moment you press it, Clark'd get off the ground and start levitating Minecraft creative style, if you hold the button, he'd go much faster in his iconic flying pose, but to the point where you could still appreciate the world around you. Double tapping and holding X would be used for whenever you'd essentially want to cross the entire map in literal seconds.

If you're on the ground and then you double tap, Clark would instantly fly couple of miles in the sky in a split second. The actual flying itself shouldn't be too difficult, you just fly wherever you're pointing towards with your left stick.

Super senses is... detective vision/spider sense, not the most pleasant way to describe it, but it's essentially the truth. I don't exactly know HOW would you differentiate it enough to the point where it doesn't feel too alienated from the powers Clark actually has, but also isn't literally just copy paste of those two mechanics, if anyone has a better idea, I'd love to hear it, let's say I'm just laying down the script so anyone potentially gets motivated to think of something better than I do.

Aside from your health bar, you'd have the solar energy meter, which is basically used for Superman's iconic, more ranged superpowers. The higher you are, the faster it'd refill, if enemies have kryptonite, it'll refill slower. If the enemies posses magical powers, upon every hit, your solar energy would decrease just as much as your health would, if the red solar power is in area, it refills even slower.

The up,down,left,right buttons would just be a quick way to shift between your powers. You'd have heat vision, freeze breath, super breath and... tiny Superman jumping from your hand or something, we'll work on that, once again, someone can recommend the fourth ability, or maybe it doesn't need to be a fourth ability and you have another request that can fill the down button.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/60mwan3j8fyb1.png?width=946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=289916fde882295357d1df68d080b44f2d2769c4

L1 would be used to fire those said powers, by tapping it, you'd do slight attacks based on the purpose. If you tap heat vision, you'll send a decently damaging ranged attack.

If you tap super breath, you can push your enemies away if you're getting overwhelmed.

If you tap freezing breath, you slow down the enemies nearby you.

Freeze takes the least amount of solar energy, heat vision the most.

By holding L1, you'd use more of the meter as well as dealing more impactful blows. Heat vision would spawn a giant laser that would tear through everything in it's path. Super breath would suck every single enemy in the area, stunned, rendering them defenseless to hit them all in a single motion.

Freezing breath wouldn't just slow them down, but completely freeze them for couple of seconds, tougher enemies or bosses would only be slowed down though, I think it makes it fair seeing as how freeze would decrease the least of your meter, so it balances it out.

Ok this next idea I'm genuinely contemplating whether it'd be too broken or OP, you can help me decide.

Ignore the shitty MSPaint yellow ""glow"" which is meant to emulate the Sun, whenever your meter is full, you could active super speed, which would completely decrease your meter, but while it's leaking, EVERY SINGLE ENEMY TYPE would be completely frozen, and you'd gain a slight boost in speed as well. Everything around you would move warped, as if you're in water. Dust would be set in place, shock waves as you're punching someone etc.

https://preview.redd.it/hy9dfnrg9fyb1.png?width=922&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=492d9edc492f8a5c38f1f2a8e1f9e196684b76e3

Again, as much as I'm trying to make it fair and square, I also want the game to make you feel RIDICULOUSLY COOL, and this would do it for me certainly.

As for some of the side content, you could have a series of missions following Myx where he gives you a variety of trolling, reality warping missions until you somehow trick him by the end. These missions should fuck with you, reversed controls for one seems like an appropriate decision, maybe a section where you play a more toonified Portal, but instead of it being just two wormholes, you could physically pick up the hole and place it somewhere else for a neat little puzzle.

I think having missions where you're Clark Kent doing regular investigating could also be nice, more stealth oriented sections where you'd need to use your wit and powers subtly enough so that no one notices.

I think during these sections, a nice gameplay switch would be to change your established superpowers into three other ones, like changing his voice to make it sound like the guy you're trying to take down, or super hearing where you can gather extra information about an underworld organization or something. You could have a single main mission where that'd be set up, but it shouldn't be overdone in the main story.

Yeah that's mostly it, what do yall think, do you have ideas you think could work better to replace some of my own decisions, maybe some ideas that are just ADDING onto the skeleton I already established, like a combination of buttons to make him do a special move or something, I didn't want to get too into it, cuz once again, I don't know exactly how this type of combat is exactly supposed to operate.",,1,,4,,public

I wonder why Chip decided to put that many time jumps in his run, first two weeks then a big eight weeks (post-Knight Terrors or during ""Dawn of DC""). It's already quite hard to put a sensible Batman timeline - especially since we also have the Orghams in Ram V's Detective Comics - which so far don't have any, big ones at least (it entered ""Dawn"" with maybe 1070 or 1071). Then we also have other characters like Nightwing, Catwoman, Joker (or ""Joker"") running around - which also have their own ongoings and/or cameos (in Tec).",,15,,18,,public

Following his experience, Tim decides that what he needs is a mentor to teach him about magic and set off for America to find Zatanna.

Along the way, he reunites with his friend Molly. Tim take her to join Zatanna on tour and learn magic from her. After Zatanna make sure Tim already talking with his family after he is running away, Zee decided to adopt them as proteges.

In the page of issue 41 above, Zatanna wake up Tim in the morning to iniate his education. Zee showing a trick of making the sun appear with crystal ornament she brought at sales (I like Zee's snarkiness when teaching Tim). She manage to execute her tricks and making Tim puzzled on how Zee doing it especially without backward spell or any kind of magic. Zatanna said she would let him know if he come for breakfast first.

After Zatanna serving the breakfast for them, the obsessed Tim still curious about Zee earlier trick. Nevertheless Molly explain the trick to Tim in which Zatanna has reading the newspaper and observes when the sun would appear by checking her watch.

The issue is lovely for showing Zatanna care to the kids and how she let Tim to learn by himself first. It's also showcasing Zatanna observations of information and her surroundings then use it to her advantage. I kinda wish the book have more training sessions of Tim and Zatanna, even though if it's just a montage. Also shame DC is late on marketing their young boy Magician and got eclipsed by Harry Potter.

DCcomics,"General Continuity Timeline Question; Which Came First; the Formation of JL, or Batman’s Robin-Acquisition?",False,3,0,"Hi, DC Reddit. I’m currently working on a small side project, but seeing as I’m striving for “accuracy” (a term used very loosely when talking about the DC timeline), I wanted to know if some of you could help me out. It would be very appreciated.

I hope how I titled this post makes my question clear, but just in case: did the Justice League form before or after Bruce Wayne took in Dick Grayson/Robin’s debut? 

I’ve done some research into ages, and Bruce’s age depiction when he takes in Dick as his ward seems to be from 24-29 (while Dick’s seems to be 8-12), and I haven’t found a concrete source for Bruce’s age during JL’s formation. All I know is that the general consensus is that Robin comes along during year 3 for Batman, so my personal guess is Robin first, then JL? Only because 3 years of Batmanning seems a little too low before his time Justice-Leaguing. 

PLEASE be as “umm actually” as you want, cuz I genuinely want to be as close as I can be. Just don’t be mean or anything (let’s hope those aren’t famous last words).

DCcomics,Too many people might not fully understand nature of Justice League,False,5,0,"Creators also must understand why JL is the only ""League"" in entire superhero genre, otherwise it will never be done right

This is the topic I'd like to discuss long ago. 
Most recent JL movie failed so badly and it got a lot of dramas behind it, it's over discussed so I won't talk about that again. 

However, what I want to address, is too many people, including a lot of writers, creators, might not truly understand the nature of Justice League. Justice League is never a simple superhero team. It's more complicated than that. There is a reason why it's called Justice ""LEAGUE"". 
People often compare JL with Avengers, consider them as equal. I dare to say that's the most misunderstanding in modern days.

Before I go further, let's talk about certain Marvel and DC teams. Avengers, X-Men, Teen Titans etc. Those are definitely some most famous and beloved teams in superhero comics. They might have different types of organizations, different team structures and scopes, but one thing is common, those are still just ""TEAMs"". What do I mean? What I mean is, these are fundamentally a structure about several superheroes form a line-up, work together to defeat certain big bad. You can easily see those teammates developed a friendship, a relationship, and a kind of family bond. 

It's basically like a sport team. You got great teammates, play the game together and spend a lot of time to form a bond. 

Okay, so what's the deal about Justice League? People might easily feel Justice League is also just several superheroes to form a team. Well, that's exactly why 2017's Justice League is fundamentally doomed because they got it all wrong. Justice League is never a team, it's an alliance, an organization, one united group with world's most important figures. It affects not only super villains, but the whole world's safety concern, politics concern and many many. It's the most powerful defense earth ever had, and it's not a place for friends but allies. Grant Morrison once said, Justice League is more like ""United Nations"".

Justice League always has a way more complicated history. Anyone has read comics know Justice League firstly debuts in silver age, a parallel universe to mirror JSA so Superman and Batman can be a part of it. It's also a time Superheroes especially DC Superheroes are not being serious. That's the ""Super-friend"" time. At that point it's no different from other superhero team, but today's Justice League, we have to go back to 90s. Grant Morrison's JLA is the archer of this organization. 

You see, traditional big seven is not random selected. They all represent the top of DC world. 

Superman-the most powerful being ever existed as well as the most influential superhero, even the center of DC Universe.

Batman- one of the richest, smartest human in earth, Wayne enterprise easily affects globally.

Wonder Woman- The princess of Amazons. Inheritance of old Gods. Recently She is even the daughter of Zeus, meaning she will one day inherit not only her island but possibly queen of old gods.

Aquaman- Already a King of Atlantis. He has the duty to connect both worlds. 

Green Lantern- no matter which human Green Lantern, they are the cops of galaxy. They can build an alliance between Lantern Corps and JL. 

Flash-Not special in terms of identity, but they connects one of the most important force in entire DC Universe. 

Martian Manhunter- The first ever alien alliance. (Superman identities himself more human than Kryptonian)

Now you see the deal? Those are the most influential people from each area. Big 7 has the power to shift not only earth but the whole universe's direction. That's why in Morrison's run, each meeting, each further expansion of league,big 7 will have to vote. That's why Batman fears Justice League's potential threat. 

So anyone wants to adapt Justice League, They can't threat JL like normal superhero team. It's definitely not. JL is more like alliance. From big seven to small heroes, it's the toughest organization affects each areas of the world",,5,,5,,public

It just seems like average editorial mandate storylines which are mediocre to bad not end of the world like others have made it out to be lol.

&gt;Working in the shadows of the DC Universe, this new covert team has been tasked with gathering an elite group of scientists for the first phase of their plan…but the Cats’ mysterious leader, Void, might have other plans!

Few years ago I was dying to get its absolute, but the thing is so rare that people on ebay where asking for around $300 on it - insane in my opinion (and budget).

I would love to get this one, specially at the actual price ($39 at amazon), but without a clear list of collected issues I'm hesitating.

Just recently I’ve been reading the comics. I’ve read Miller’s Batman classics, The Long Halloween, All Star Superman, and a few other critically acclaimed ones. Also have read just a few misc. other ones, like The Joker War Saga. All of it ranged from good to really good for me, but nothing made me think “this is EXACTLY what I wanted, this is 100% up my alley.” At least, not until Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow. 

What I liked most was that it’s set as a companion telling the story of the hero, as opposed to third person or superhero POV. Ruthye being the POV was perfect for me. It let me view supergirl through a unique lens, and it was a great way to present the relationship between the two characters.

DCcomics,[DISCUSSION] Is Wonder Woman Bulletproof Or Not?,False,802,0,"From what I've looked into, the easy answer is, she is sometimes bulletproof. There have been a few stories I've looked into where she is bulletproof. But most of the time, it appears that she is not bulletproof. That's why she blocks bullets with her bracelets and shield. But it's not even bullets, it's anything that can penetrate her skin, so swords and any type of blade would count.

That just makes me think though, how does an alien like Superman, or any Kryptonian, or any alien or even super-human who is invulnerable to bullets and blades, why is it that these people are invulnerable to things like this? But someone like Wonder Woman. One of the STRONGEST memebers of the Justice League. A literal demigoddess. Created from somebody as powerful as Zeus, the King of Gods. An Amazon warrior who has beaten several INCREDIBLY powerful gods, aliens, and supervillains. How come Wonder Woman with all of these feats and powers, immortality included, can easily get injured and die from a simple 9mm bullet and/or knife?

I was wondering that, because I was watching Smallville in its first season in the episode 3, and well the moment was that when the Coach Arnold was trying to convince Clark to join the football team, he said to him that Jonathan Kent was part of the football team when he studied in the high school adding that Clark has his genes, and Clark responds that he is adopted. And that moment raised me that question, since I never seen that before, and well there's some comics or other TV series that ever showed that Smallville or other close friends of Clark Knet know that he is adopted?",,34,,84,,public

DCcomics,"What's the ""canon"" teen titans rosters and relationships for each robin?",False,3,0,"I'm a newer comic fan so I don't have the luxury of knowing the decades of history when it comes to comic knowledge. One of the harder things to track is the relationships of between characters. Some are easy like with the bat fam or justice league. However the teen titans and Robin's are impossible with how many iterations and retcons that follow those characters. Sometimes dick Grayson has the classic roster while other times it's Tim or damien that has the classic roster. Sometimes dick and speedy are besties while in others it's jason and speedy. So help me decipher this mystery so I know what the general consensus is.


Here's what I know so far:

Dick Grayson either has cyborg, Starfire, Raven, and beast boy or he has aqua lad (garth), wonder girl (donna), speedy, and kid flash (wally west). He is beties with wally and dates any red headed girl in his life. 

Jason doesn't have a titans team but is besties with speedy both are failed sidekicks I guess

Tim drake has superboy, impulse, wonder girl (cassie), and some how members of dick's titans even though they shouldn't be teens anymore. I think he dated cassie but stopped when he went crazy after batman died. 

Damien some how has anyone mentioned previously but also sometimes has a completely unique roster too. He also sometimes dates Raven and he was besties with Superman's kid until he was aged up for dumb reasons. R.i.p super sons comics",,16,,3,,public

DCcomics,"What to do with Supergirl as a character? (A conversation, and writing help for a fan fiction project)",False,1,0,"Supergirl is one of my favorite characters.  In fact, if I were to make a top 10 list of my favorite comic book characters, the #1 and #2 spots are always the same; Batman occupies the #1 spot by a wide margin, but the #2 spot is occupied by both Catwoman and Supergirl because I can't pick a favorite between those two characters-- I like them both for very different reasons.  The other eight spots on the list can change depending on my mood and other factors, but the #1 and #2 spots are always the same.

But sometimes with Supergirl, it seems like DC is just throwing stuff against the wall to see what sticks.  With Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and other characters, DC has found something that just 'works', but with Supergirl it seems like they are having trouble finding that 'groove' she fits into.  

Due to the popularity of the CW show (where Supergirl was essentially just Clark Kent/Superman) it does seem like some of the more recent Supergirl comics are taking her character in a similar direction, which is kinda disappointing.  I think a friend of mine phrased it best when he described the show by saying ""They took a character who should have a personality like Thor and gave her a personality like Peter Parker instead.""  

Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the CW show, I liked it for what it was, it entertained me, and that's all you can really ask for.  I watched about five seasons of the show (I think) so I definitely didn't hate it, but I'd like to see Supergirl become a more distinct character, and writing her to be more like Clark Kent/Superman will not accomplish that.  My favorite origin story for Supergirl was the one where she was taken to Themyscira to train with the Amazons.  At least I like that concept, anyway.  The execution of that concept wasn't great, I'd have liked a story that focused more on Supergirl's time on Themyscira.  If I were to write that story, maybe I'd give Kara a more timid personality that was a result of growing up on Krypton, and she'd become more like 'the god of thunder' after living with and training with the Amazons, but I'm just spitballing.  

Anyway, even if we go with the Amazon origin, that still leaves us with a question: what is Supergirl's 'thing'?  Or, the title of this post: ""What to do with Supergirl as a character?""

The reason I ask is that I am working on a DC Comics fan fiction project, and this is a question I have been grappling with lately, so I was hoping to get a conversation started with other fans of DC Comics, and maybe bounce some ideas off of people, and that sort of thing.  

My ideas thus far are to spend a little time focusing on Kara's life on Krypton in the last few weeks (or so) before its destruction-- which is something you couldn't really do with any other character except maybe General Zod.  After her escape pod is discovered, and she is released from it, Kara goes to Themyscira to train with the Amazons, and she will eventually become the adopted daughter of Queen Hippolyta, which (of course) makes Wonder Woman her adopted sister.  After Kara leaves Themyscira I'd like to see her become BFFs with Catwoman because a Supergirl/Catwoman crossover has something that's been on my 'wish list' as a fan for a long time now.  But I'm having trouble coming up with ideas about how to set Supergirl apart as a distinct character.  She has all the same powers Superman has, she has training similar to Wonder Woman, and hangs out with Catwoman, but what is Supergirl's 'thing'?  What is on your 'wish list' for the character, as a fan?  

Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this and engages in the conversation! :)",,11,,1,,public

DCcomics,Why can’t villains just be villains?,False,239,0,"I’m sick of the new trend that every well-liked villain must become some sort of anti-hero. In the last few years, it seems to have become a common theme that any popular antagonist will switch to becoming somewhat friendly with the protagonist at a certain point in the story. Obviously this isn’t just a problem in the DC universe but I would argue that it has one of the most severe cases when it comes down to a particular bat-wielding, white-faced sidekick. 

Harley Quinn has gone from being a full-blown psychotic, evil sidekick, who had sympathetic qualities but was still very much evil, to a quirky, friendly hero, who is best buds with the Bat Family and wants to do good in the world, despite still clearly being unstable. I understand that they wanted to promote a good message by having her leave her abuser, but her character motivations make no sense in recent projects and it’s clear that most of her scenes are used to please fans, with sassy one-liners and her getting on unrealistically well with everyone and their mother. Why should she keep the Harley Quinn alias at all if she is done with the joker? How is she stable enough to leave the relationship but still clearly insane in every other way?

Harley clearly doesn’t work as a hero, mainly because most of her character is being evil and unpredictable, and I wish that DC would just make her the evil sidekick again, or if they want some development, let her leave/kill the joker and become an bigger villain on her own, or even with Poison Ivy. Not every good character is moral and kind and I think we need to remember that a villain can still be compelling, sympathetic and even rooted for, without becoming a hero. ",,207,,239,,public

DCcomics,[Discussion] The Problem with the Super Family,False,35,0,"As someone who loves DC's legacy characters, I appreciate all of their superhero families. I love the Super Family too and in concept, they work really well but they have a weird problem that's become very apparent after the current Action Comics run

The Super Family is too dependent on Superman. What I mean by that is every member of the Super Family has some sort of defined relationship with Superman but there is not a single other defined dynamic between the members (Maybe the Steels because they are family by blood) but in general, they don't have a solid dynamic that can be defined. I can't think of one legitimately interesting dynamic between two Super Family characters that doesn't involve Clark. This is not a problem with most of the other families. You have dynamics like Dick/Damian, Roy/Connor, Max/Bart, Donna/Cassie, Garth/Mera etc that exist without involving the primary, popular character. But for the Super Family, I feel like if you take out Superman, they are just a bunch of strangers

Part of this can be attributed to the fact that the second and third most popular members, Kara and Conner, have undergone several revisions that's made it impossible to create a defined dynamic between them but even after all these years, it's still a problem. Can anybody even define the dynamic between Jon and Conner or Jon and Kara etc? It's impossible to because it has barely been explored

I think the Super Family works in concept and it can easily work better if writers put some effort into actually creating some defined dynamics between the members instead of solely relying on Superman's relationships with all of them. That's the biggest problem behind the Super Family

DCcomics,What Are You Reading? 10/23/2023 - Changing Leaves Edition,False,6,0,"# Hello and welcome to our Weekly ""What Are You Reading?"" topic!

Come one, come all, to this weekly thread, where you can openly discuss books that you've read, are currently reading, or plan to read.

## Predaplant's Rec of the Week:

* [**Behold, Behemoth**](https://d28hgpri8am2if.cloudfront.net/book_images/onix/cvr9781684159109/behold-behemoth-9781684159109_hr.jpg), by Tate Brombal &amp; Nick Robles

With Brombal doing his first DC work as a part of the upcoming launch of *Green Lantern: Dark* as a part of the Elseworlds line, I figured it was worth checking out some more of his previous work. There's a lot of duality at work in this one: it runs with a plot device involving connections with both heaven and hell, it jumps back and forth between two time periods, and there are two lead characters. Brombal &amp; Robles manage to build out strong protagonists existing within an intriguing world that I wish they were able to explore within a full ongoing setting... but even this one short TPB that we get with it is highly appreciated, and I'm very glad I checked it out.

So, what are *you* reading?

DCcomics,Thoughts on Paul Levitz?,False,6,0,"What are your thoughts on the guy? I think DC was far more successful when he was VP under Jenette and later Prez and publisher. He knows business, is a wonderful writer (LEGION of Superheroes etc.) From a fan perspective, I really love him and he was a lot better for DC (IMO) than DiDio. 

That said, I have heard on CBR forums, and other forums, but cannot verify that he is kind of a prick personally, according to certain creators. I dunno if that's fair because I am not a comics pro and do not know about DC office politics or industry politics.

Apparently, there was an incident in an elevator between Levitz and Mark Millar that caused bad blood. And apparently Geoff Johns once got very mad at him for some reason involving Levitz shooting down an entire year's worth of  Johns' stories. Something else went down between him and DiDio before Dan took over. I don't know... what I think is, regardless of such hearsay, I like Levitz and really respect him for loving the medium and being really good to DC. What are your thoughts?

DCcomics,Mark Waid is killing it with Worlds Finest!,False,327,0,"Waid is often hit or miss for me. I love his FF, Kingdom Come, and Flash... For me, those are the standouts.

But this new Batman/Superman thing? It's EVERYTHING DC COMICS SHOULD BE. Dan Mora's art is fantastic. His Batman is a mix of silver-age and bronze-age goodness and if you look at the way he draws him, there's hints of Batman'89 in the costume (OMG!) .

Waid gets these characters to a T and I love that he brings in so many disparate elements and makes them fit together. It feels like a DC Universe that anybody can get into. Old heads like me and younger readers and anybody can enjoy it and his storylines are so original. At times it feels like a perfect Justice League book but most of the time it's just Batman and Superman being exactly who they are.

I've been away from the DCU for about 13 years BUT It's the best thing I've read in years, including every indie book I've read since 2010.

I feel like Waid was born to write this and I don't want it to end.",,72,,327,,public
