Marvel,Was MCU Thanos Actually Right? (Eternals tie-in),False,1,0,"I've never been wild about 616 Thanos in the comics. He's had a couple of great story arcs but Jim Starlin's proprietary interest in his version of the character stunted his development to some extent. The anthropomorphic, regularly appearing version of abstract cosmic entities into 616 has slowly rendered what should be distant, alien and incomprehensible beings into just one more kind of gaudy superhero/supervillain, and never more so than in the idea that Thanos is in love with and regularly speaks to Death.

Like a lot of people, I found the MCU Thanos to work pretty well in the two highlight films that he's central to (Infinity War and Endgame). He's menacing, powerful, reflective, a bit melancholy, but also petty, especially his time-jumping version who shows up for the big battle in Endgame. But as many people have observed, his ultimate goal seems if anything to make even less sense than being in love with Death, a cosmic abstraction who appears to him as an attractive partner. 

Until Eternals, in a way that I don't see a lot of people talking about. I didn't love Eternals, but if you follow what they introduce about the nature of the Celestials, it may make Thanos' plan make a dramatic new kind of sense, to the point that he might be 'right' technically. E.g., the Celestials hatch from planets inhabited by sapient beings *who have reached a certain level of population and technology*, destroying those beings but preserving a balance that keeps entropy at bay. Suppose it turns out that Thanos' plan was based on him *learning the truth* about the Celestials and deciding that in order to preserve intelligent species across the universe, they all had to have their populations cut in half to extend the time they had before a Celestial emergence destroyed them completely. Which in a weird way also makes him an ally of Death (entropy) because he's impeding the emergence of enough Celestials to prevent the universe tilting towards entropy. 

It actually all adds up--and it might explain what's going on with the appearance of Eros at the end of the Eternals film. It doesn't *seem* at the moment that this is going to be a Chekov's gun that will drop in The Kang Dynasty or Secret Wars and yet it's possible to imagine how it might. E.g., if the threat of the Kangs turns out to be just a distraction from the Celestials basically stepping in to be the Beyonders of Hickman's Avengers/Secret Wars, that they were alarmed enough by Thanos' use of the Infinity Gauntlet that they decide to destroy the multiverse and start over, only to be opposed by some assembly of various multiversal characters (possibly including some of the folks on board the spaceship at the end of Eternals). And it might be interesting for any OG Avengers who get involved to learn that Thanos was responding to a real threat, if by means that were as almost as bad as space-giants emerging from inside of sapient planets. (It might also be interesting if it turns out that the few really advanced and powerful alien civilizations encountered so far--Kree, Xandar--turn out to be civilizations that either killed their Celestial or that learned how to keep their population levels just low enough to avoid Celestial emergence.)

Marvel,Logan(2017) plothole?,False,0,0,"At the beginning of Logan, logan and the group don't kill the bad blonde guy on the spot but instead delegate the task to Caliban, who has to FIRST travel with the guy alive who can wakes up at any moment, and only once arrived to destination kill him. Terrible idea, huge nonsense risk, Caliban even asks ""what if he wakes up""?To which Logan' answer is not making sure he won't ever wake up, but knocking him up ""harder"" instead (still fails miserably). Now being this movie as highly regarded as it is, I immediately thought that this wouldn't have had a big impact on the story later, making it a forgivable mistake overall. But no, it leads directly to the death of Caliban, and undirectly to the death of the black family and even Charles Xavier himself. Still a good movie of course, but this ruined my immersion in the first half hour, I didn't expect it in an otherwise flawless movie",,5,,0,,public

Marvel,Dreamy Thoughts on Marvel Spotlight.,False,18,0,"I hope that its similar to the cw shows in structure where they mostly have independent stories and maybe occasionally cross. But arent beholden to the stroct structure of the films. 

Darkhawk is PRIME for a tv show. He doesnt have a fanbase and could be crafted anew. He has cool  powers    and would make for a great cheap monster of the week style show. 

Stilt man needs to debut already. Hes been referenced a million times already. Id like the show to open with a montage of mcu heroes kicking his ass for petty crimes. He then decides to change and try to be a hero. This could be a family show where he comes from a family of criminals who are trying to change. 

3D man is a very obscure guy. He too like DH has cool powers. An aventure show with him could be very unique and quirky. He was also a MVP during secret invasion in the comics. 

Heroes for hire. We ALL been asking for it. They should ignore all the previous events and just launch with luke and danny kicking ass across the marvel universe. A buddy cop procedural is TV 101. I dont know why we already arent on season 7 of a heroes for hire show.",,2,,18,,public

Marvel,Avengers Secret War,False,0,0,"Now that #Loki has control over his time-slipping, he can travel through time &amp; space.

Basically he is now an OP character of the MCU.
He can do time traveling &amp; also Universe hopping.

And, he knows very well what’s coming! He is scared for what’s coming.

Also he knew very well that the Avengers time travelled. If Loki becomes the incharge of the TVA, he will definitely look into the activities of the Avengers from the Sacred Timeline. He will understand who is the reason behind the time travel. Also he will see how Tony Stark has sacrificed his life to save the Universe.

Loki might rewrite the story, save Tony Stark from sacrificing himself.
Because, Loki needs Tony Stark. A genius who can be extremely helpful &amp; a huge asset in the war with Kang.

Hence, this could be a possible way, Tony Stark might return back.

If Tony’s death is an absolute point in time in Earth-616 &amp; cannot be reversed back, Loki would hop into a different Universe, and bring a Tony Stark who has the same soul as our 616 Tony.

Marvel,What Ever Happen to A.X.E.: Judgement Day?,False,0,0,"Marvel's *Judgement Day* was a crossover event that had gotten a fair amount of praise when it came out and, while ending on a rather lousy note, many people seem to put it as one of the better Marvel Comic events as of late, plus it promised that it would change the Marvel universe in big ways and be remembered for a long time. But now that nearly year has passed since it's conclusion, I can safely say it failed in that promise. Why? Because it has left virtually **no** impact or consequence or true change to status quo on the Marvel Universe and nobody in-universe talks about it in a meaningful way, to the point that it can be completely skipped and nothing would be missed.

And really, what was the point? The Eternals went back into obscurity, Krakoa kept going without much hassle (until its recent *Fall of House of X*, but that's its own deal), and the Avengers kept being the Avengers. And outside of *Sins of Sinister* (which itself was more an alt-universe event), the event is pretty much never brought back up in any meaningful capacity. It really has left no major impact outside of minor details that could be glimpsed over.

Will Marvel every bother with the Eternals again? Will people remember how it was the heroes that created the Franken-Celestial that nearly wiped out humanity? Will the new Ajak Celestial do **anything**? It's all honestly sounding like a resounding ""No.""

Marvel,"Genuine question: What is the need-to-know basis for Venom, lore wise?",False,0,0,"Hi everyone. So, I'm asking this question in particular because I've been meaning to write a full fledged story for Venom. Like, I want to write an origin story about someone becoming Venom (I was thinking maybe Eddie), but I want to get the lore straight before I go all willy-nilly with the writing. I also want to write this story that tries to be different, but isn't that far from the lore. Like it stands out, but pays respect to the source material. Also, I am aware there's multiple depictions of Venom, like the Eric Forman Venom from Spider-Man 3 (yes, I know it's Topher Grace, but he'll forever be Eric to me), the Harry Osborne Venom (I believe is Venom in the comics), and of course, Eddie Brock as Venom (The Tom Hardy depiction for Venom's own movie), but one I want to focus on, is mainly Eddie becoming Venom.

Just a witch supporting a fellow witch. I won’t make this post too long but I wanted to share my love the Scarlet Witch who’s been a big part of my life.

I’ve been following her for a very long time and essentially bought every digital comic she’s been in all the way back to her first appearance X-Men #4 (1964).

A big shout out to my favourite artists:

Russell Dauterman, Lorenzo Tammetta and Sara Pichelli for their amazing work during the newest Scarlet Witch series. I phased out of physical copies awhile ago, but the moment I saw them working on Scarlet Witch, I had to get physical copies and have them on display. 

In the future I will have these framed along with my other prints from Russell Dauterman, David Nakayama and other artists, but for now, this is my little “altar” dedicated to my favourite witch.

Still waiting on 3 statues from hot toys to come in as well but I know this case will continue to grow overtime! :D ",,3,,4,,public

That's textbook definition the difference between parasitism and symbiosis.

So I'm wondering are there any stories where the symbiote is actually a symbiote and is actually bonded to a person and they work together and do good?

Similar question, it seems the symbiote went evil after Peter rejected it in the comics. Would it have actually been a good guy (Good being whatever) if Peter had not rejected it?",,9,,0,,public

I had big expectations for it. Season 2 has felt a little off. Don't get me wrong, it's still very enjoyable.

Some of my complaints - what are the stakes? What happens if the TVA fails? I'm sure they've said it, but it doesn't seem clear. Does the multiverse collapse? Is it just the people on the TVA? Is the sacred timeline affected? Some branches got pruned, but the show hasn't made me care about it enough to feel that those are people. They've killed more people than anyone in the MCU except maybe Thanos (probably more than Thanos) but it doesn't feel like it.

Loki does not feel like Loki. He is supposed to be an anti-hero, and yet he hasn't done anything that is anti, he's just been a hero who talks about hope. I get that he watched the movie in season 1 that supposedly brought him up to speed on his MCU development, but still.

What is everyone's motives? Why so many different factions that don't have clear motives/consequences? Renslayer, Sylvie, Mobius, Hunter B-15, the minute men, Miss Minutes.

Angel is a moderately powerful mutant who was exposed to a death seed by apocalypse, which vastly expanded his powers, developed a secondary mutation which gave him a healing factor and the ability to heal others, and is a billionaire so could probably have access to Stark tech or have Forge make weapons for him if he so wished. 

They are both members of powerful teams and have years if not decades of superhero experience at this point.

Now where this might make me think captain america is based off Adrian Carton de Wiart is well due to the super soldier syrum wich well made him inviceble and pretty much unkillable pretty big simularaties there imo but this is just a theory that came into my head months ago🤷‍♂️

This maimed him in one leg but also turned him into a hero, making him incredibly popular at school and earning the respect of Flash Thompson, who became Peter's best friend. The young Parker was able to balance his intense social life with his studies, graduating with an Osborn scholarship and going to ESU with Flash, after which Peter landed a job as a scientist for Oscorp. In Spider-Man's absence, his role was taken by the other person who was bitten by the radioactive spider, Cindy Moon, aka Silk, who became New York's prominent hero.Even in this new life, Peter Parker felt the urge of doing something heroic, so he became Silk's ""tech guy"", building her gadgets and acting as her support. Overall, Peter's life in this new reality is perfect (except for the leg injury that requires him to use a crutch).",,12,,115,,public

Marvel,I really feel like the Weapon Plus Program (as originally envisioned by Grant Morrison) was a fantastic idea that COULD have been used to connect so much in the Marvel Universe…and they squandered the hell out of it.,False,13,0,"Or, to quote “The Bourne Legacy” in regards to every writer that’s touched the concept after Morrison created it for Marvel:

“You were given a Ferrari and your people treated it like a lawnmower”

Like…how do you screw up something SO PURE and SIMPLE as a classic “behind the scenes government conspiracy that connects the dots on previously unrelated characters” literary trope??? Morrison laid out all the damn rules and what each number did…and then they just retconned the ever-living shit out of most of it and BARELY followed the original concept!

Why wasn’t Rocket Raccoon a product of Weapon II or III, as well as other animal-based heroes and villains? Hell, even have The High Evolutionary’s New Men looped into the program and be responsible for their creation! “II” would have been cybernetically enhancing animals, while “III” would have been using genetic modification to create animal/human hybrids!

Testing on ethnicities and prisoners (IV and V) was a fucking klaxon call screaming “Luke Cage”…and they STILL found a way to fuck it up and make Luke’s creation part of a WHOLLY DIFFERENT PROGRAM (the next one, VI), while using one (IV) to be responsible for MAN-THING, and capitalizing on “V” for the other and using it to create “Sym-Soldiers” (wounded soldiers with a symbiote grafted to them) instead because “Venom” starts with a “V”?!!? Such poverty of imagination…🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻

This is ESPECIALLY egregious because both the German AND United States governments had been studying American Super-Soldier John Steele’s body since AT LEAST 1918, and this man possessed superhuman strength and INDESTRUCTIBLE SKIN…and NOBODY THOUGHT TO TIE THIS INTO THE MOST POPULAR CHARACTER WITH THE SAME ABILITIES WHO WAS ALSO A BYPRODUCT OF THESE PROGRAMS?!!?

Weapon VII they did fine with, so I have no notes there. A rare win with this concept…but then again, it’s pretty tough to screw up cybernetic-enhancements 🤷🏻

Then, virtually NOTHING with Weapon VIII, which was supposed to create sleeper soldiers and assassins using drugs and hypnosis, and could be fantastic if they ever decide to tie it to like, the Red Room or the Widow Program…so I guess we’ll see 🤷🏻

IX being responsible for the creation of Typhoid Mary via “Project Psyche” seems like a nice segway from “mind control” and “personality-alteration”, to “Mutants”, so I’d say another W so far.

After that, I can’t say as I have any problems with it, as THAT PART was utilized immediately by Morrison.

With “X” it began turning Mutants into living weapons, which eventually branched out into its own program, while XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, and XVI continued on, with the only one not really touched on being “XI”.

“0” was revealed to be the African-American soldiers experimented on with the prototype version of Cap’s serum, and Cap being “Weapon I”…and I loved that too. Everything that followed was an attempt to recapture the “lightning in a bottle” miracle of Steve’s creation, and it works beautifully conceptually…but instead of just sliding the correct pieces into place like a puzzle with the rest, it was transformed into a patchwork, Frankenstein-esque abomination that jammed square pegs into round holes, and tried to convince us it was everything BUT 🤦🏻

One of my biggest gripes is that there was nothing SPECIFICALLY for alien beings, or supernatural creatures.

Why were the Sym-Soldiers created around Symbiotes, when grafting a variety of different alien genetic material from different species to wounded soldiers is a MUCH COOLER concept??? Skrull, Kree, Shi’ar, Inhuman, and Symbiote DNA could’ve created some amazing characters, and formed the basis for a SWORD strike force of human soldiers with alien abilities that defend against extraterrestrial threats…not just a synergistic one-off to tie-in to a Venom-centric crossover event.

A program number devoted to supernatural creatures could have explained the origins of the “Howling Commandos” SHIELD squad, and looped in Hannibal King, Blade, the Midnight Sons/Suns…and yet, we got nothing 🤷🏻🤦🏻😔

What a waste… 🙄🤦🏻",,3,,13,,public

Marvel,Why are so many people saying Killmonger from Black Panther is a “good guy”?,False,15,0,"I've heard too many people say that his plan was a good one, and that he should've won. But listen to his speech. He believes in oppression and genocide. He's turning a peaceful nation of scientists into warriors and talks of killing children, as well as burning the heart-shaped herb. He's selfish and malevolent, too wrapped up in hatred to see straight. He's not a character to follow, but to pity, and his death was exactly that. He was someone who should've been by T'Challa's side from the start, and we see his potential wasted on hatred. Michael B. Jordan did such a good job in this role and deserves every commendation for it, but Killmonger wasn't a hero. To be a king you must be diplomatic and not a tyrant. He put his own selfish ambition and pride before he thought about his kingdom his people and race. 

“The sun will never set on the Wakandan empire.”

Spoken like a true colonialist and imperialist. Killmonger really is everything he’s fighting against.

Had Killmonger won and created his Wakandan Empire, it’s obvious how he’ll treat people of African descent and Anglo-Saxon descent 

But what about the other races, Latino, Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander, Indian, etc. 
many of these races and others had their share of being victimized by prejudice 

Would they In Killmonger’s world be treated any different? Or would they be victims too as in his likely Wakandan Surpremist world, those not of direct African descent would be treated inferior yes?",,19,,15,,public

One of the Kangs says “We do not know of this variant” another asks “Who are you?” Doom says a single line: “I. AM. DOOM” and the stadium starts blowing up. In the aftermath we see Doom leave the way he came. 

Cut to black. 

So that would be my way of doing it. The reason for the I Am Doom line is because it is a call back to Endgame Iron man and a moment from the second Secret Wars comic where he confronts the Beyonders. 

How else do you think it could be done if you were the one doing it?

Lots of rabbit trails. Usually, I'm able to track down answers but some things have me stumped and I'd appreciate some help.    

Details: In **Storm #4** from 1996, near the conclusion of the issue, Mikhail Rasputin says he must leave because *""...he will be angry.""* Just two pages later, we see Dark Beast brooding. It says that Mikhail was *""...working under his instruction.""* It's fairly obvious that Dark Beast was tinkering with Morlocks' genetics, and he recognizes Marrow as a result of his efforts in **X-Men Prime** from 1995 (alluded to in **Generation X #6** and **#-1** from 1994 and 1997 respectively). It also seems like Mikhail teleporting the remaining Morlocks to the Hill dimension in **Uncanny X-Men #293** was an unplanned act of desperation (or impaired judgement), but the idea that it would accelerate the creation of Gene Nation feels very Dark Beast-y... there's just no connection that I can see. So.    

Question: Other than this reference in the **Storm #4** book, is there any other evidence that the two were working together, either before or revealed later?

The teasers show us that Peter is becoming Spider-Man as an adult, married and with children. Considering he is now a family man there is something that to my knowledge we have not seen before in a Marvel Comic: 

First: the old Peter Parker - young Tony Stark relationship. We have always seen (due first the New Avengers run and later the MCU) a kind of mentor/protegee between Tony/Peter. Now that the ages are reversed we can have Peter play the old wise, experienced man to Tony”s reckless behavior as Iron Lad. 

Second: the Peter - Reed relationship. As usual Spider-Man mythos are deeply connected to Marvel’s first family, you can even say he is part of it. Reed has been in 616 a figure of respect and the rest of the FF have been his support during most of Spider-Man history. Now we can say that with Reed becoming the Ultimate Universe version of Doom, Peter is the the family man which Reed could eventually rely on, even becoming an extended member of the Parker family. 

Third: the Spider-Man - Captain America relationship. This maybe a long shot but as usual Steve “old/idealist” ways have always clashed with a futurist like Tony Stark, but considering that Tony is essentially a teen in this universe a better balance can be made between Peter and Steve. The clashing ideals of a man of an old age (Steve) and the man of the modern era (Peter)

Marvel,Lets help marvel get it together for the BLADE reboot. Whats your pitch?,False,0,0,"1. Personally i think they should just bring wesley back. Since most of his adventures happened in the 90s he couldve been active in the MCU the entire time. Have him be an old school clint eastwood gun slinger type. Successful in his war against the suckheads he comes outta retirement to stop a returned threat. Eventually he puts together Midnight Suns as he knows he wont be around forever. 

2. If they go a with a new route for blade i think that one, he cannot emulate wesley. And second, i would want his costume to be different. Contrary to popular belief blade actually already had an all black look prior to the films. Id like a younger actor that can do 3 to 4 films of hard stunts and unlike keanu, mahershalla dont look like he been training. Though if he did start training like keanaeu who is also 50 he can stay. For the first film for the love of Odin just give us John Wick with vampires. How hard is this? Unlike the 1st trilogy which was grimey i want the new blade films to be more luxury like the wick films. Lets see just how filthy rich and evil these 1,000 year old vampires are. Id also want them to show off more of blades powers like mind control and his ability to grow wings. Hes essentially a good version of dracula amd his moveset is more than just martial arts and guns. Id also want him to fight other style monsters.",,10,,0,,public

There are rumors that Marvel will do the same thing as DC. That they’ll reboot the entire Marvel franchise after Secret Wars. This doesn’t sound like a bad plan, but there is a massive issue: we are *a long way* before Secret Wars. 

Look, Antman 3 was Marvel first loss. People aren’t interested in The marvels. Even the director herself left the movie. They have revealed nothing about the Fantastic Four. We are currently one and a half phase away from the Secret Wars, and if they only do a few more movies like Antman 3 they are gonna end up in a *serious* financial disaster. And even if they do manage to reboot the franchise, they’re gonna have to start from scratch. They would have wasted so many popular stories by then: Secret Invasion, Gorr the god butcher, Secret Wars, etc. so it’s gonna be really hard for them.

Maybe Marvel movies will have the same fate as western movies. Maybe their time is really over.",,18,,0,,public

  Essentially what I'm trying say is have the Comics become the MCU with no separation of continuity. Make the comics look like the actors. Like how all of Star Wars Media takes place in the same universe.

  Of course we could still have else world and What If type stories but for the sake of continuity just make it easier for Marvel fans. So you don't have to read 100000 comics to understand what is going on.

TLDR: After the Secret Wars movie reboot Marvel. Have one single canon for the whole of Marvel instead of separating comics from movies.

Information as said before, movies, promotional materials, and shows (including
Netflix shows and AOS lol).

Marvel,"If Edward Norton was never replaced as Hulk/Bruce Banner, how different do you think all the resulting movies (all the Avengers movies and Thor Ragnarok) would’ve turned out? Not just his character, but the feel of the movies?",False,0,0,"Hi.  

Hope you’re doing well.  

Was just relearning about how he actually wanted to continue as Banner/Hulk, but it was Marvel (primarily Feige) who was against him returning and it got me to wondering, how would the movies he appeared in have changed just because of the actor playing him?  

That scene in the first Avengers movie in India that alluded to the deleted scene in 2008’s The Incredible Hulk where he had a gun and put it in his mouth and “the other guy spit it out” was so dark and I feel like Marvel only included Ruffalo’s Bruce saying that as a sort of fan service. But apparently most people who saw test screenings of that original scene with Norton didn’t like it, probably because it felt too dark.  

I can’t help but think that if we got *that* Hulk/Bruce for the rest of the movies he was in (we got a little in AoU, but then it completely changed after that), then it would’ve vastly changed how the other characters interacted with him and ultimately changed the vibe of the movies.   I just can’t imagine Norton’s Hulk joshing around and behaving fairly immature and like “The Stupid Avenger” with Thor in Ragnarok the way Ruffalo did.

But I do still think Ruffalo has still been very good in his performances, but his Hulk after AoU has lost a lot of steam and presented like more of a joke more often than not (except for when he was grieving the death of Natasha/Black Widow in Endgame).  

Feige has done a lot right and he deserves credit for the success of the MCU, but I feel like the use of Hulk/Bruce Banner in general (whether played by Norton or Ruffalo) and ousting Norton (probably because he wanted more creative control, but we may not know the full reality here) has been a weakness of the MCU.  I’m not saying Norton would’ve been drastically better than Ruffalo, but his approach I feel would’ve served the character better.

How do you think all of the movies as a whole that Hulk has been in would have felt like if either Norton was still in the role or Ruffalo played it similarly dark?",,21,,0,,public

After 2019’s Spider-Man: Far From Home, I kind of gave the MCU a break for a while. I had planned to get back into it after the next movies, but Covid happened and I just gradually forgot about it.

After watching Winter Soldier randomly a few nights ago, I wondered about picking up where 2019 left off…however, while I’m aware of the all the Disney + series in the MCU, I haven’t watched any.

And frankly, it seems kind of daunting to absorb all those shows…I remember starting to get into MCU 2/3 of the way in, and having to watch something like 10 movies just to get up to speed for Infinity Wars. And while I enjoyed almost all of them, it was still a slog of sorts.

So, my question: do I absolutely NEED to see the the Disney series’  to understand the next phase of movies. I’d be starting from Black Widow onwards

Even if I see them all, how much of them will need to retain to grasp where Phase 4 (or whatever we are) is about?",,0,,1,,public

Of course they would probably have to give him a bit of an upgrade strength-wise, but still. Imagine Kraven wants to hunt someone on the Avengers.

Like Hawkeye for example he would be able to take out as an example for the others. I can imagine a panel in a comic or scene in a movie where Kraven is emerging from a burning building, a hero laying down unconscious or dead on the ground nearby, and another hero come to stop him. What do you all think? Could Kraven be a good Avengers Villain?

Marvel,Spider-Man's public perception,False,0,0,"I wish the movies/other media adaptations would explore the negative public perception Spider-Man gets outside of J.J.J.'s vendetta from the comics. The movies/shows/games always go straight to making Spider-Man an adored celebrity-status hero, with everybody loving him almost immediately like he's Superman or the Fantastic Four. It doesn't always feel genuine IMO. I want to see more mistrust among the police/public, things like people being creeped out by his costume, etc.

I think the MCU in particular was a missed opportunity to explore the public being weary of Spider-Man, because he's not the only hero in the MCU unlike the Raimi/TASM movies, and it would have shown a different side of things given how the other Avengers were already so adored in-universe.

Obviously No Way Home explored Spidey being shunned, but that was because he was being publicly accused of a murder. To me it sometimes feels like Spidey adaptations are looking more at the adoration from IRL fans/bias of his popularity IRL rather than in-universe.",,6,,0,,public

Ewing does the same but doesn’t get as big name projects and usually seems to support the “architects.” He really needs to headline/“drive”Avengers or X-Men. He straightened out Nextwave’s place if even just to bury it and his books are always fun at the very least.

Kieron Gillen might occupy this third spot but with just two character specific and relevant issues JMS has returned and made Captain America a must buy. This feels like it could be Cap’s equivalent to his Ezekiel and What are gods worth arcs from his previous works. Marvel, just let him cook. Do your Sieges and Wars somewhere else.",,24,,24,,public

Marvel,Idea for a Spider-Man cartoon,False,0,0,"In this cartoon Peter, Gwen and Eddie are the same age and were close childhood friends but eventually drifted apart and that's when Peter met Harry and MJ. Eddie never got over his feelings for Gwen. When it comes to writing Peter's girlfriends I admit I haven't the faintest clue but since we've seen plenty of MJ already I'd have Black Cat as the main love interest. I'd have this cartoon take place in the same continuity as my X-Men cartoon:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/11np6ln/idea\_for\_an\_xmen\_cartoon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/11np6ln/idea_for_an_xmen_cartoon/)

**Season 1 main villain: Kingpin**

Spider-Man's first battle is against the Black Cat. Most of the villains Spider-Man initially fights are ones motivated by money hired by Kingpin for criminal heists e.g. Shocker and Rhino with Black Cat often taking advantage of the chaos from the battles to slip away with the money. To tie in with the X-Men cartoon at one point Spider-Man fights Gambit when he's still a thief. Kingpin hires Bullseye to kill Black Cat but she's aided by Spider-Man. In retaliation Kingpin hires Kraven to kill him but Spider-Man is aided by Daredevil. Kingpin manipulates the two of them into fighting Punisher but the trio put aside their differences and in the finale take down the Kingpin who's arrested. There's a subplot involving George Stacy and Jean DeWolff who have been trying to bring down Kingpin for a while. Jean initially dislikes vigilantes for getting involved but by the end she's grown to respect Spider-Man and when she catches Spider-Man unmasked he deliberately turns away before she can get a closer look.

**Season 2 main villain: Norman Osborn**

Norman takes an interest in Spider-Man when he realises that he got his powers from one of the spiders in his lab and eventually realises he's Peter. When Norman meets Peter he secretly leaves the Venom symbiote in his room, knowing it will bond to Peter. Meanwhile Black Cat proves to be a thorn in Norman's side when she steals from him and Norman hires the Juggernaut to kill her but once again she's aided by Spider-Man.

I'd take heavy inspiration from the Ultimate comics for Venom. Peter and Eddie's fathers worked for Norman Osborn who confiscated the Venom symbiote and had them murdered. Osborn performed all kinds of horrific experiments on the symbiote, driving it insane but could never control it or get it to safely bond with a host without killing it. Peter is the first person to safely bond with it due to it being created with his father's DNA and that allows it to safely bond to other hosts afterwards.

Norman sends different supervillains such as Sandman, Mysterio, Electro, Morbius and Kraven (who's keen to challenge him when he learns how strong the symbiote has made him) after Spider-Man to test the symbiote's capabilities, each fight making Spider-Man slip further into the symbiote's bloodlust, culminating in him tricking the Hulk into fighting Spider-Man. Once he's satisfied he wants to claim the symbiote so he becomes the Green Goblin and goes after Spider-Man. Spider-Man almost kills Osborn in a fight but spares his life and removes the symbiote which bonds to Eddie who's outraged that Peter didn't take the opportunity to kill Osborn and takes it upon himself to kill Osborn and anyone who stands in his way.

Meanwhile Richard Fisk takes over his father's criminal empire and has assigned Roderick Kingsley to infiltrate Oscorp.

**Season 3 main villain: Venom**

The destruction Venom causes in his mission of revenge brings him into conflict with Peter who's reluctant to fight his friend and requires Black Cat's help to beat as well as other villains and heroes such as the X-Men, Punisher and Daredevil. In the finale Venom kills Norman and Harry vows to avenge him. In the first 2 seasons we see Curt Connors a few times as a friend of Peter's and it's hinted he knows that he's Spider-Man and in this season he becomes the lizard.

**Season 4 main villain: Harry Osborn**

Harry becomes the Ultimate Green Goblin and battles Spider-Man and Venom who are barely able to beat him but he's able to capture a sample of the symbiote which he uses to create more symbiotes, each one stronger than the last. In the finale he creates the Carnage symbiotes which he forcibly bonds Gwen to who easily bests them but they defeat her when they upgrade the Venom symbiote to Anti-Venom. Peter and Eddie reconcile and Eddie leaves for San Francisco, becoming an antihero.

Meanwhile Roderick Kinglsey becomes the Hobgoblin and overthrows Richard Fisk.

On a side note for an Anti-Venom spin-off, the Carnage symbiote bonds to Kletus Kassady.

**Season 5 main villain: Kraven the Hunter**

Kingpin has been released from prison and takes back his empire from Hobgoblin. We're also finally introduced to Dock Ock who before then had just been talked about. For the finale I'd adapt Kraven's Last Hunt. Kraven is able to bring down villains who Spider-Man either needed allies or the power of the symbiote to defeat including Kingpin.

**Season 6 main villain: Doctor Octopus**

Doc Ock forms the Sinister Six to bring down Spider-Man and Black Cat but he finds an unlikely ally in the form of Morbius. Spider-Man starts training Miles Morales to be his eventual successor.

After that I'm not sure where to go next. For a 7th season I've considered adapting the clone saga but with the Hood as the main villain who created Ben Reilly.",,0,,0,,public

Marvel,"Now that Miles is around, Marvel needs to give Peter his marriage back and let him grow up",False,164,0,"First of all, been reading ASM for 20 years since I was a little boy. i was so young with the clone saga came out I thought it was good.   


I am so sick of the way peter has been written from Slott onwards. Peter Parker should not be Peter Pan. I'm tired of the character doing the same shit and constantly being regressed in annoying ways because someone at marvel thinks the character won't be relevant if he's ever really allowed to permanently grow up in 616/ASM.   


I get why they used to do this... but now we have miles. And miles means there is literally NO reason to keep doing this -- in fact spiderman overall as a brand would be so much better and peter and miles so much more differentiated if they would just stop this and let peter age up. Just let he and MJ be together. No more stupid will they won't they drama, write them going through the challenges of a LOVING couple who are nevertheless committed to each other raising a family. He doesn't have to stop being a hero because he's not a kid. It would be so much more interesting to see him juggle the responsibilities of a marriage/family with his responsibility as spiderman,   


The comic readership is no longer all 18 year olds and it never will be again. Let peter be for us older bros who grew up with him Let him be the wizened experienced vet who mentors Miles. If you wanna do some teenage young people bullshit in a comic book just use Miles. I'd rather see Peter struggling with guiding miles, trying to help him not make the same mistakes he's made, etc. The problems adults who care about the up and coming generation face -- I would gather at this point this would be MORE relateable to peter's core fanbase than the way they keep writing him.

Marvel,My Thoughts on why the MCU needs less than more content,False,0,0,"  

Just an early morning thoughts while having coffee and coming back to MCU comics from decades of being absent. The overwhelming number of books and movies almost makes it seem that the MSU has lost its way.

Marvel movies and comics need to move away from Disney. It is okay Marvel, not everyone needs spin-offs or even their own movie lol and comics are taking the same route. Marvel needs to take on the motto "" less is more"". If we take the best writers, artists, inkers, and condense we will have a better MCU. I would take 2-3 group/team comics and 4-5 hero comics, and the rest trash it. Then the best writers, artists, and inkers can create great content. Enough with the multiverse, forty versions of crappy Spiderman, and fifteen versions of Wolverine, we understand it is about the Mighty $$$ but as they say, ""Crap in crap out"". 

Don’t get me wrong, I love comic books and the multiverse was a good idea but it’s like using a rubber stamps. Now those stamps are so good, your happy, and love those stamps. But eventually, a stamp gets old and worn out. Its time for a new stamp, let’s see, I can go back in time to bring that stamp back, or its time to throw it out. Instead of that stamp, now you can now focus on the current stamps without the need of Multiverse.

Marvel,"Linear, A to B, clear storylines",False,3,0,"Hey everyone,

I'm teaching an elective class called History Through Marvel to 6th, 7th, and 8th graders this year. NYS has a concept called ""Enduring Issues"" that are basically overarching themes one can find all throughout history. For example: conflict, impact of technology, scarcity, etc. The goal of the class is to use those Enduring Issues themes to make connections between Marvel, history, and current events. 

In the class, we started with X-Men: The Animated Series and students easily made connections to the Enduring Issues theme of Human Rights, connecting the treatment of mutant kind to various events in history, particularly the Civil Rights Movement. Currently, we are in the process of reading the Secret Invasion storyline. Students are making connections but with a little less ease. I started with New Avengers Volumes 8 and 9 because I didn't realize Mighty Avengers Volumes 3 and 4 existed. I assume those take place before NA 8&amp;9 but we are reading them next anyway. Are there any other book collections in the Secret Invasion storyline that I'm missing? Book compliations are preferable to individual issues for the sake of the class. 

Aside from my mistake with NA 8&amp;9 and MA 3&amp;4, the students have struggled to follow the Secret Invasion storyline. I assume there are parts of the story I accidentally left out that would have provided more context for the events taking place in NA 8&amp;9 and MA 3&amp;4, but even so, it jumps around a lot and has been a little hard to follow.

I'm looking for recommendations for Marvel storylines that are more linear and have a more obviously defined beginning, middle, and end. Something a little more straightforward that the average middle school reader could easily follow.

Marvel,What is the largest number of 'earths' known to be present at the same time within Universe-616? Might be 5.,False,1,0,"Weird question, but some of the stories I've been reading lead me to believe that the answer, up until the incursions, was at least 5.

1. Earth-616. The normal earth that exists in Universe-616.

2. Earth-148611, the New Universe. In an issue of Quasar from the 90s, the Stranger transported Earth-148611 to Universe-616 near his home planet to study the white event energies. The Living Tribunal decided that was too dangerous, so he blocked any being from getting near that Earth, but it still existed within the physical space of Universe-616 until the incursions.

3. Earth-311, Marvel 1602. Initially the past of 616 being destabilized, it was fixed, but Uatu the watcher grew attached to the earth, so he was given a recreation of this earth placed within a jewel to observe as sort of a pocket dimension. It still existed within the physical space of Universe-616 as we can see in stuff like Fantastick Four 1602 where the heroes can see Uatu watching them.

4. Counter-Earth, Heroes Reborn. Initially a pocket dimension created by Franklin Richards to save some of Earth's heroes, at some point Doctor Doom brought it over to Universe-616 at the opposite side of the sun from the real Earth. The Exiles use the fact that both Earth's exist in 616 to trick Proteus during the World Tour arc.

5. Counter-Earth, High Evolutionary. I'm the most iffy on this one because I haven't read any of the comics it appears in but from what I can tell this version of Counter-Earth seems to still exist in 616, hidden at a different vibrational frequency than the main earth.

Marvel,How freshen up Peter Parker spider-man,False,0,0,"So this post will definitely be controversial but I actually think it’s a cool idea 

So even though marvel technically haven’t reset there entire universe before (unlike DC) they still reboot various characters now and again. Well imo they need a reboot of Peter Parker asap but everything about spider-man is 10/10 rn (games, movies, other runs) except TASM 

Again this suggestion is rather controversial but my suggestion is to cut back basically on every Spider-Man story and just have Peter, Miles and maybe Gwen. But my suggestion is to remove the Peter being older dynamic and have Peter and Miles the same age in either high school or college (but in school) I don’t suggest doing an origin story for either again (like in ultimate) but just have it where they’re the same age and have the school - spidey dynamic. And instead of one looking up to the other, they can be more friends then miles looking up to Peter. It would be a major reboot but I really think we need something ‘new’",,2,,0,,public

Other than a few 90's Fantastic Four issues and a few appearances in the 2010's Dan Slott She Hulk series (which is really good); they don't appear too much anywhere.

Marvel,"Cover &amp; Synopsis Revealed for ""What If... Wanda Maximoff and Peter Parker Were Siblings?"" Novel by Seanan McGuire",False,116,0,"Wanda and Peter Parker embrace great responsibility in the next adventure of an epic multiversal series that reimages iconic Marvel origin stories.

So many worlds, so little time. Infinite possibilities, creating infinite realities. Long have I watched death court the Scarlet Witch. But . . . what if Wanda didn’t have to suffer her grief alone?

All Wanda has ever known is her friendly little neighborhood in Queens. As an infant, after her parents died, she was adopted into a family where her doting Aunt May and Uncle Ben will always be at the breakfast table. One that includes her idiot brother, Peter Parker, who thinks hiding a spider bite, joining a secret fight club, and becoming a superhero are somehow good ideas.

When Wanda’s own powers emerge, blood, chaos, and suspicion follow in their wake. But as she harnesses her power under the guidance of Doctor Strange, Peter is standing beside her in the Sanctum Sanctorum. And as they try to protect New York City, the Parker siblings learn that with great powers, there must also come great responsibilities—and greater loss.

Reeling from tragedy, Wanda finds herself truly alone for the first time in her life. Peter is lost to his own grief, and so she must strike out on her own. But on her first solo outing, she runs into a mysterious speedster—a man named Pietro. And everything she has ever known shatters like glass.

Faced with unbelievable truths, Wanda is forced to choose between the life she knows and the life she could have.

Marvel,"As much as I enjoy most of the TV shows, I kind of want a generic super hero story",False,0,0,"Many of the Marvel TV shows have been great. I really enjoyed Wanda Vision and Loki, as well as Moon Knight. Some of them have been kind of eh like Ms. Marvel and and Secret Wars.

The thing is, none of these really feel like super hero shows. 

Like my ideal super hero show would be like live action versions of 90s X-men or Ultimate Spider-Man.

 Fully costumed heroes majority of the time. Not waiting until the last episode to reveal the not very comic accurate costume. 



Lots of uses of super powers. In the entire of Loki season 2 for example Loki has used his powers like....twice? He's a God who can use all kinds of spells yet never really uses them. I want to see energy beams, Fire bolts, magic, etc of all the heroes involved.



 Lots of action. I feel like in She Hulk nothing really happened. She's literally got thr strength of the Hulk but we barely see her fighting and using light poles and stuff to beat the crap out of enemies. 

 Episodic villains. I don't need to know thr villains backstory,  they don't need to feel sympathetic or super well written. Sometimes I would just like to see a hero and villain clash. Imagine a live action Spider-Man show where every episode is against one of his big bads. I don't need a super convoluted story.

Just a standard good vs evil story. No need for social commentary, misleading the viewers of what is good or bad. Make it black and white,  show the good guys win, make it fun. 

I think the MCU in general is my least favorite form of super hero media.

I love the comics, been reading them since I was a child.

I love the video games, I grew up playing games like Maximum Carnage, Seperation Anxiety, X-men arcade, Marvel Ultimate Alliance, X-Men Legends,  Marvel Heroes, etc. All these felt like good fun adaptations of the comics.

I love the animated TV shows like 90s X-men, Ultimate Spider-man, 90s Spider-Man. 

Everyone is finally getting MCU fatigue but I've had it since the mid 2010s because they never really felt like how the comics are while every other form of media brings that comic style to life.",,15,,0,,public
Marvel,United Imperial Sol,False,0,0,"What if some charismatic leader, probably Magus of we are honest but I don't really want to focus on who leads it, was not only super popular in the US but a global personality and perceived security expert on extraterrestrials pushed for and won a solar system wide referendum uniting all intelligent life in the solar system into a single empire for the sake of safety from the aliens. 

I am talking about the kind of government that could get Doctor Doom, the Leader, and MODOK to work hand in hand with Black Panther, Mr Fantastic, and Bruce Banner to find ways to work with the Deviants, Eternals, Inhumans, Atlanteans, and High Evolutionary to combine all of their technologies along with all the alien tech leftover on earth into standardized equipment for use in the Empire. 

A government that could give orders to Doctor Strange, Selene, Brother Voodoo, Agatha Harkness, Daimon Hellstrom, Scarlet Witch, and Magik to work together to secure the earth dimension under it's governmental supervision. 

If such a United Imperial Sol could be forged and respected inside the solar system what kind of respect would it command outside the solar system?

Marvel,What I think Insomniac are setting up for future games,False,0,0,"&gt;!I believe we will get a venom game, and it'll be about the anti venom symbiote leaving peter, finding Eddie Brock and somehow the symbiote turns into a normal black venom symbiote whilst maintaining being ""good"" (basically the tom hardy films venom/cates' run on venom's version). I think we could get Lasher, Phage, Agony, Riot and finally Hybrid as the villains of the game alongside the arch enemy of course Jack O'Lantern. However, Knull is slowly being set up. !&lt;

&gt;!Then Spider-Man 3 happens, Peter and Miles (and now Silk) face against various villains, Chameleon wanting to kill Spidey cause Kraven failed, Green Goblin as Norman has the G-serum created, Carnage as Cletus has the symbiote now, and finally, Otto as he creates a clone body of peter parker and puts his mind in it (instead of body swapping as I know people dislike it, plus it allows me to add something interesting). Chameleon and a clone of Peter can both simultaneously ruin both Peter's reputation and Spider-Man's (a reflection of Peter damaging his own reputation from the symbiote, now its being done and he has no control over it this time). When they beat Otto and put his mind back in his body, a piece of Peter and Otto are in the clone, having it's own personality and becoming Ben Riley (Scarlet Spider). Also, with Carnage, him being a cult leader pre symbiote may be deliberate so he continues whilst having the symbiote, but the cult becomes a Knull worshipping cult (Like from the Cates run, like the whole spiral symbol and Venom wings), further setting Knull up.  P.S. Yes, Carnage and Green Goblin come together as Red Goblin, obviosuly.!&lt;

&gt;!After all that, I would do a game that's a mix about Cindy Moon and Ben Riley, further progress them as characters and face off against villains such as Morbius, Jackal, Hobgoblin, Beetle, Smythe (Spider-Slayer), Hydro man. A slight theme of people being turned into ""monsters"" unwillingly, whilst versing a Spidey who is a clone and some may perceive as a ""monster"" too.!&lt;

&gt;!Then it all culminates in Spider-Man 4, Knull and the symbiote invasion, King in black is a marvel universe level event however it needs to be scale downed a bit in heroes, that's why there are multiple Spider characters (Peter, Miles, Cindy, Ben, Eddie) that also has various other symbiote villain roles in the lead up to Knull such as Toxin, Scorn, and Raze, alongside Knull's army too, plus Harry as Kindred (possibly a mix of symbiote and G-formula) after everything that happened within the 3rd game with his dad becoming crazy over him being in a coma. Other villains to fill the game up a bit could be Carrion (clone of Miles Warren aka The Jackal), Molten man, return of Rhino possibly (If Kraven didn't kill him). At the end have Eddie sacrifice himself, the symbiote ends up with Flash Thompson who honours both Harry and Eddie and becomes Agent venom/a hero.!&lt;

&gt;!If they wanted to do another one, Spider-Man 5 could be about the spider-verse, fully explore other universes (Mainly would focus on the important ones, Miguel 2099, Gwen, Noir, adult mayday (as MJ is pregnant during the 3rd game, has a little girl in the 4th game), spider-ham, and that's all, plus the other 5 characters- Peter, Miles, Cindy, Ben, Flash). They face the inheritors and Morlun, Ben sacrifices himself (Morlun think's he killed Peter so kind of like parent trap, in order for Peter to live and raise his Mayday).!&lt;

That's all I've got, any suggestions or things to add/take away would be appreciated, hope y'all like my ideas.",,2,,0,,public

I hate the fact that the MCU killed him off and made shuri BP. I also feel like they didnt fully explore his universe as big as they couldve. 

1.they couldve built an entire wakandan avengers team by itself due to all the tribes in Wakanda alone. The wakandans are animist so im quite sure they worship other beings who can grant powers

2. Why introduce bucky as white wolf and do nothing. They shouldve had bucky over a special assasination squad that eliminates major villians as the white wolf. It wouldve been a way for him to redeem himself for all the innocents he killed. This wouldve made a dope disney plus special. 

3. Not seeing tchalla vs namor is a damn crime. I personally wouldve liked for them to be friends for a few movies. So when they fight its actually sad. The fact they rushed it just feels weird. 

4. They should make a Batman TAS bp tv show. Hes prime for it. Wouldve been better money spent than groot. 

5. It just amazes me that BP is a batman level character and Marvel just does nothing with it. Wakanda forever made more money than The Batman without the main character.

* why did the Exodus clones not do anything to interfere with the other quiet council members? 
* were the Genesis Wars ever covered in a comic or just referenced at this point? 
* what was the point of the spirit of vengeance Galactus? It seemed like it did nothing except show up and get shot by Juggernaut 
* I'm assuming this one especially, but among other answers here, is \*hand wave ""Just comic stuff"" but how did they beat Otherworld world if it's all realities and timelines without? Saturnye, Merlin, Dr. Strange, etc. should have been able to seal off Otherworld if not outright win ... was a tactic ever mentioned that I missed that the Sinisters used to win?
* I don't really understand how the Quiet Council wasn't controlled by Sinister but all the other clones / rebirths were? I get that he wanted them to have some amount of their original personalities but they still had the kill switch presumably so why not the mind control? 
* whether it's actually true or not... am I reading the ending implication right that Mother Righteous was the Sinister Dominion? 
* What did Moira do different than what Mother Righteous wanted to do herself? MR wanted to send back the baby, not herself, but seems like it's the same result? Why did Moira want to do this?  !&lt;

Stranvers aka Doctor Strange/Carol Danvers is one of mine. I don't love it, it's the Clea/Strange life for me, but I don't get the hate either. I just think it's neat. Maybe I have a hitherto unheard of weakness for a flying brick dating a wizard. Imagine them as a fighting duo, Stephen enhancing Carol's punches with magic? 😩😩😩

Also, VoodooWitch aka Jericho Drumm/Wanda Maximoff. The comics casually forgetting they were even dating made me feel bad for Jericho lol in the right hands, this relationship could be very interesting. They have a good amount of shared lore already, tbh. I've always thought Wanda would do better dating a fellow magic user. And Jericho is also a mental health professional. This is meant to be y'all.

Marvel,Did anyone else know this about Eros?,False,2,0,"I found it on the MCU Wiki.

*Eros was created by Arishem the Judge and was stationed along with nine other Eternals on Titan. There, he joined the royal family of Titan and was given the mantle of Prince, becoming the adoptive brother of Thanos. Prior to Titan's demise, Eros rebelled against Arishem and fled Titan, becoming an outlaw. While traveling through the cosmos, he created Pip the Troll to be his companion. Following a trip to Mystery Planet, Eros was given the name Starfox.*

*On one journey, Eros and Pip the Troll encountered a being called Black Roger. When Black Roger was deemed an adversary, Eros defeated him. This act greatly affected Pip, who admired Eros and went on to introduce him to those they met as the defeater of Black Roger.*

*In 2024, upon learning about Arishem’s judgment, Eros transported himself alongside Pip to the Domo, where he met with three Eternals, Thena, Makkari, and Druig. Druig asked him why they were there and Eros, with a Celestial Communication Sphere in his hands, declared that he knew where their friends were, offering his partnership.*

Where does this information come from? A producer or something? Because none of this was mentioned in his little scene in the movie. And Eros seems like a pretty powerful Eternal if he was able to create life from scratch. Curious to see what his MCU powers really are (I don't think he'll have the same powers that he ahs in the comics).

Marvel,How does the Cosmic Ring/Freedom Ring’s power work?,False,5,0,"Hey guys. Last night I came across a video on youtube about heroes who are not known and Freedom Ring was one of them. I was just confused by how the rings’ powers worked. I thought Cosmic Cubes are like wish granting objects in a way wherein all you needed was to speak/think what you want and it’ll happen, I assumed the Cosmic Ring did the same since it came from a fragment of a Cosmic Cube, just a much weaker way since the range the ring affects reality is capped at 30 feet.

In another video it stated that Curtis Doyle had to concentrate for them to be able to get up when they were paralyzed, but on another part of the comic they simply thought about ice cream for it to appear.

My question now is, had they stopped concentrating would the ice cream disappear? 

Couldn’t they just ‘wished’ to be able to walk and the ring would grant them that? 

If he wished himself indestructible why were they impaled? 

If they were beside a table and wished for ice cream on top of it and moved more than 30 feet away from said table would the ice cream disappear or would it have stayed?

Marvel,What would it look like if every mutant was as powerful as possible while staying stable and in control of their powers?,False,7,0,"hat would it look like if every mutant was as powerful as possible while staying stable and in control of their powers?

What if Cyclops fully actualized his potential and had complete control over his powers? 

What if it was Jubilee, Cypher, Wolverine, Nightcrawler, or Angel? 

I think we might be already seeing this with Iceman but can you imagine if Storm truly worked on what it means to command the cosmic storm! Or musical winds that blow between dimensions? 

I think it's really neat to think of Blob with omega level gravity powers and him being extremely skilled with them. 

Here is one way we could see it. 

What if all this time what Beast has been secretly working on has been infiltrating and assimilating the genetic engineering knowledge of the High Evolutionary, the Deviants, the Inhumans, Sinister, Apocalypse, and others? Now he has perfected a variant of the Terrigen Mists that unlocks any mutants full potential and grants them instinctive knowledge of how to use that potential without becoming unstable? 

I imagine of course he would test it on him self and finds that he has been transformed into a basic human shape but is now a shape shifter that can take on any superpowered animalistic forms he can imagine,like a bat form for the air and a seal form for the sea. No matter what form he takes he still has his super strength, speed, endurance, agility, pheromone control, heightened senses, healing factor, and maintains his genius intellect. 

Marvel editorial would make it temporary or something because having all mutants permanently powered up would break too many stories but even if they could use it for temporary boosts I think it would be cool. 

Who would you want to see with their full potential powers unlocked and what do you imagine they would be like?

Do you think Marvel would ever allow such a story?

Marvel,New to comics! Questions about the reading guides.,False,1,0,"I've been getting more and more interested in reading Marvel comics, but I'm very overwhelmed by the amount that is available to me. I would love some guidance from a veteran because I have some questions regarding the comic reading order lists I've found online.

In all other books/media I really like to read everything and get to know every little detail, really soak up all the lore. My ideal situation for reading the marvel comics would be to start at the first one and end with the last one released. Buuuutt.... with marvel this would simply not be possible because of the vast amounts of comics. So I've decided to settle on one of the many lists of ""reading orders"" that are out these.

I've always loved the Blade movies with Wesley Snipes, so I'm going for that character's list. Specifically the list from [comicbookreadingorders](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/marvel/characters/blade-reading-order/).

Now here come the questions and my confusion about this list (which extend to all lists I come across)

&amp;#x200B;

1. In this list  Tomb of Dracula #10 is the first title to read. I understand that in this story, volume #10 is where Blade will make his first appearance. But... why would I start with volume #10 just to only see Blade? I am reading them for the story and not just Blade, won't I be dropped in the middle of the story like starting with season 4 from a series? Won't it be better/more fun to just start from volume #1 to also get to know the story where Blade happens to be a part of? The same goes for other comic series further down the list.

2. I've searched online and the Tomb of Dracula volumes are very hard to get or very expensive. There are multiple examples of this. Is there a way to still read these comics or is it then better to just skip them?

3. Why in this list are they started with Blade Vol. 4 #1 (2002) after ToD? Why shouldn't I read Vol. 1 - 2 - 3? Are these considered ""bad"" stories? It still would contain Blade right?

4. I've come across an Omnibus that will be released next month which contains all the early stories from Blade. This seems awesome and the best fit for me. But won't this be the exact same problem I describe in my first point? Just its and bits of random Blade stuff from all different kind of stories where the stories won't make much sense since I'm being dropped in? I've never had Omnibusses so I don't know if this is more for the collector or actually good for reading up on all the stories.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading and hopefully you can give me some tips!

Marvel,Your thoughts on my version of Scorpion?,False,0,0,"I wish to know your thoughts on my own version of Scorpion. To avoid spoliers where I can, seeing Scorpion in the Spider-Man 2 game really invigorated a feeling in me. A feeling I only get when I fantasize about writting and conceptualizing a new character. This characters name will be Deathstalker. Deathsalker is a species of highly-dangerous scorpion found in Northen Africa and parts of the Middle East. This species of scorpion is what inspired my versions name. 

This is a complete rework. No shade to the original writers and artists who gifted us with such a masterpiece. However, this is simply a humble fan's interpretation that couldn't be achieved without inspiration. Here is a simple break down of his childhood, what he was like, and what lead him to become Deathstalker. 

Deathstalker exists in the same continuity as Spider-Man, Venom, Black Cat, Vulture, etc. However, his most important affiliate in his respective universe is to the Avengers Iron Man who enhanced his physical abilities once becoming a sort of mentee or student to him. This would come after his time in the education system. His time in school would prove troublesome and stressful. He was a rather... different as a child. He was constantly drawing and writting his own horror stories which would often come hand-in-hand. Despite the rather dark ambiance that surrounded him, he was a kind and gleeful kid when it counted and when he cared. This would lend to his more anti-hero tendencies. In high school, he would start to write his own comic series based around horror, fantasy, and superheroes which would take off pretty good. This newfound notoriety would make becoming  Deathstalker very hard with all of the attention from online forums and fan pages who would eventually idolize Deathstalker. Unknowingly idolizing the very man who wrote, drew, and illustrated their comic books. However, this did not stop him from becoming Deathstalker. Sometime after becoming said hero-anti-hero he was approached by Iron Man with an offer for upgrading from his bulky and heavy suit to a more sleek, lighter, more agile suit that didn't compromise on strength. With these upgrades came some new abilities that may be seen below.

PHYSICAL ABILITIES:
His physical abilities include an upgraded, configurable tail equipped with...

- A sharp blade and a lethal supply of venom that makes his targets hallucinate (as seen in Insomniac's Spider-Man games). Or if need be... inject a fatal, fast-working, toxin if the situation requires it. 

- Another configuration was a clubtail used to inflict heavy, physical blows (as seen in Spider-Man Friend or Foe).

- Another configuration was the ability to retract claws from the tail which was used to lift heavy objects or used in offensive capabilities.

- Another configuration was a collaboration between Iron Man and Deathstalker. This collaboration was to install Deathstalker his very own singular repulsor in his tail which would shoot out powerful energy blasts of energy.

- Taking inspiration from Mk. XVIII or ""Cassinova"", Stark was able to place a very powerful unibeam-like technology as to allow Deathstalker to shoot a very powerful and very concentrated ""telsonbeam"" blast from his tail. Heavily-advanced stealth technology was also installed allowing Deathstalker to stalk his prey for more efficient work. In part taking inspiration from Mk. XXIV ""Tank"" with the offensive capabilities aswell as the defensive capabilities too. 

- Taking inspiration from the Mk. XXV ""Striker"" or ""Thumper"" was the construction iron man suit and was capable of destroying steel and concrete structures. This technology was placed inside his tail so that when his tail is in the ""clubtail"" configuration, his attacks are concidered earth shattering and ridiculously powerful. In part taking inspiration from the Mk. XXIX ""Fidler"" aswell. 

- Taking inspiration from the Mk. XXXV ""Red-Snapper"" was the powerful claw on Deathstalker's tail which could be used for disaster relief, terrain manipulation, and offensive attacks. The more maneuverable and agile aspects of the armor are in part inspired by the Mk. XXXIV ""Southpaw"". 

So, a recap on the abilities Deathstalker have are.
- Sharp Stinger blade
- Clubtail for powerful physical strikes (backed by Mk. XXV and XXIX technology)
- Claw for offensive and terrain altering abilites (backed by Mk. XXXV and Mk. XXXIV technology)
- Telsonbeam inside the tail to inflict very powerful and very concentrated energy attacks (backed by Mk. XVIII and Mk. XXIV technology) 

This is not even close to a finished product. This is very much still in its concept phase and needs major work. I am very much willing to answer any questions about Deathstalker, his abilities, his backstory, and more. :) I'll also be posting realized part-by-part series on Deathstalker on my Tiktok page called @Khaotic_Kharibo where I'll be discussing this character from now and on.",,1,,0,,public

Marvel,I'm on a journey and I'm only 0.134826191% of the way there,False,13,0,"A while back I asked this kind community for recommendations for which comics I should start at as a beginner. I got plenty of helpful suggestions and was told to get Marvel Unlimited, which I did.

The thing is, I logged on and saw just how many comics there were and decided I couldn't skip them all, because my brain hates that. So I made a compromise; I would only read comics relating to the 616 universe. In my head, that made sense and was a reasonable adjustment.

I have been following Travis Starnes' 616 reading list and have been fast approaching comic number 50. I just finished reach the Fantastic Four's first encounter with the Hulk.

So I skipped to the end and saw that there are a whopping 34,118 comics so far, undoubtedly more as I keep reading. 

I've read 46.

I won't stop however. These comics are gold, and I've really fallen in love with them, even if currently the enemies are inevitably the Russians at every turn.

At this rate, I should be done in roughly 1483 months (or just over 123 years), so I'll probably be picking up the pace a little now. Previously I was just reading on my laptop but I've added my phone to my arsenal to help things along.

Like a lot of people, I found the MCU Thanos to work pretty well in the two highlight films that he's central to (Infinity War and Endgame). He's menacing, powerful, reflective, a bit melancholy, but also petty, especially his time-jumping version who shows up for the big battle in Endgame. But as many people have observed, his ultimate goal seems if anything to make even less sense than being in love with Death, a cosmic abstraction who appears to him as an attractive partner. 

Until Eternals, in a way that I don't see a lot of people talking about. I didn't love Eternals, but if you follow what they introduce about the nature of the Celestials, it may make Thanos' plan make a dramatic new kind of sense, to the point that he might be 'right' technically. E.g., the Celestials hatch from planets inhabited by sapient beings *who have reached a certain level of population and technology*, destroying those beings but preserving a balance that keeps entropy at bay. Suppose it turns out that Thanos' plan was based on him *learning the truth* about the Celestials and deciding that in order to preserve intelligent species across the universe, they all had to have their populations cut in half to extend the time they had before a Celestial emergence destroyed them completely. Which in a weird way also makes him an ally of Death (entropy) because he's impeding the emergence of enough Celestials to prevent the universe tilting towards entropy. 

It actually all adds up--and it might explain what's going on with the appearance of Eros at the end of the Eternals film. It doesn't *seem* at the moment that this is going to be a Chekov's gun that will drop in The Kang Dynasty or Secret Wars and yet it's possible to imagine how it might. E.g., if the threat of the Kangs turns out to be just a distraction from the Celestials basically stepping in to be the Beyonders of Hickman's Avengers/Secret Wars, that they were alarmed enough by Thanos' use of the Infinity Gauntlet that they decide to destroy the multiverse and start over, only to be opposed by some assembly of various multiversal characters (possibly including some of the folks on board the spaceship at the end of Eternals). And it might be interesting for any OG Avengers who get involved to learn that Thanos was responding to a real threat, if by means that were as almost as bad as space-giants emerging from inside of sapient planets. (It might also be interesting if it turns out that the few really advanced and powerful alien civilizations encountered so far--Kree, Xandar--turn out to be civilizations that either killed their Celestial or that learned how to keep their population levels just low enough to avoid Celestial emergence.)

A stunt actor was killed in a terrible car accident in Georgia along with three of his children, one of whom was a newborn baby.

The other two children in the car, a 10-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl also died, while one child, a three-year-old, is in the hospital with severe injuries but is expected to recover.

The fatal car crash happened on an exit ramp on Interstate 20 in Dekalb County, Georgia. Taraja Ramsess, a stunt actor famous for his roles in Avengers movies, was driving a pickup truck with all of his children on Halloween night when it collided with a tractor-trailer.

This maimed him in one leg but also turned him into a hero, making him incredibly popular at school and earning the respect of Flash Thompson, who became Peter's best friend. The young Parker was able to balance his intense social life with his studies, graduating with an Osborn scholarship and going to ESU with Flash, after which Peter landed a job as a scientist for Oscorp. In Spider-Man's absence, his role was taken by the other person who was bitten by the radioactive spider, Cindy Moon, aka Silk, who became New York's prominent hero.Even in this new life, Peter Parker felt the urge of doing something heroic, so he became Silk's ""tech guy"", building her gadgets and acting as her support.

Marvel,I really feel like the Weapon Plus Program (as originally envisioned by Grant Morrison) was a fantastic idea that COULD have been used to connect so much in the Marvel Universe…and they squandered the hell out of it.,False,16,0,"Or, to quote “The Bourne Legacy” in regards to every writer that’s touched the concept after Morrison created it for Marvel:

“You were given a Ferrari and your people treated it like a lawnmower”

Like…how do you screw up something SO PURE and SIMPLE as a classic “behind the scenes government conspiracy that connects the dots on previously unrelated characters” literary trope??? Morrison laid out all the damn rules and what each number did…and then they just retconned the ever-living shit out of most of it and BARELY followed the original concept!

Why wasn’t Rocket Raccoon a product of Weapon II or III, as well as other animal-based heroes and villains? Hell, even have The High Evolutionary’s New Men looped into the program and be responsible for their creation! “II” would have been cybernetically enhancing animals, while “III” would have been using genetic modification to create animal/human hybrids!

Testing on ethnicities and prisoners (IV and V) was a fucking klaxon call screaming “Luke Cage”…and they STILL found a way to fuck it up and make Luke’s creation part of a WHOLLY DIFFERENT PROGRAM (the next one, VI), while using one (IV) to be responsible for MAN-THING, and capitalizing on “V” for the other and using it to create “Sym-Soldiers” (wounded soldiers with a symbiote grafted to them) instead because “Venom” starts with a “V”?!!? Such poverty of imagination…🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻

This is ESPECIALLY egregious because both the German AND United States governments had been studying American Super-Soldier John Steele’s body since AT LEAST 1918, and this man possessed superhuman strength and INDESTRUCTIBLE SKIN…and NOBODY THOUGHT TO TIE THIS INTO THE MOST POPULAR CHARACTER WITH THE SAME ABILITIES WHO WAS ALSO A BYPRODUCT OF THESE PROGRAMS?!!?

Weapon VII they did fine with, so I have no notes there. A rare win with this concept…but then again, it’s pretty tough to screw up cybernetic-enhancements 🤷🏻

Then, virtually NOTHING with Weapon VIII, which was supposed to create sleeper soldiers and assassins using drugs and hypnosis, and could be fantastic if they ever decide to tie it to like, the Red Room or the Widow Program…so I guess we’ll see 🤷🏻

IX being responsible for the creation of Typhoid Mary via “Project Psyche” seems like a nice segway from “mind control” and “personality-alteration”, to “Mutants”, so I’d say another W so far.

After that, I can’t say as I have any problems with it, as THAT PART was utilized immediately by Morrison.

With “X” it began turning Mutants into living weapons, which eventually branched out into its own program, while XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, and XVI continued on, with the only one not really touched on being “XI”.

“0” was revealed to be the African-American soldiers experimented on with the prototype version of Cap’s serum, and Cap being “Weapon I”…and I loved that too. Everything that followed was an attempt to recapture the “lightning in a bottle” miracle of Steve’s creation, and it works beautifully conceptually…but instead of just sliding the correct pieces into place like a puzzle with the rest, it was transformed into a patchwork, Frankenstein-esque abomination that jammed square pegs into round holes, and tried to convince us it was everything BUT 🤦🏻

One of my biggest gripes is that there was nothing SPECIFICALLY for alien beings, or supernatural creatures.

Why were the Sym-Soldiers created around Symbiotes, when grafting a variety of different alien genetic material from different species to wounded soldiers is a MUCH COOLER concept??? Skrull, Kree, Shi’ar, Inhuman, and Symbiote DNA could’ve created some amazing characters, and formed the basis for a SWORD strike force of human soldiers with alien abilities that defend against extraterrestrial threats…not just a synergistic one-off to tie-in to a Venom-centric crossover event.

A program number devoted to supernatural creatures could have explained the origins of the “Howling Commandos” SHIELD squad, and looped in Hannibal King, Blade, the Midnight Sons/Suns…and yet, we got nothing 🤷🏻🤦🏻😔

What a waste… 🙄🤦🏻",,3,,16,,public
Marvel,Why are so many people saying Killmonger from Black Panther is a “good guy”?,False,17,0,"I've heard too many people say that his plan was a good one, and that he should've won. But listen to his speech. He believes in oppression and genocide. He's turning a peaceful nation of scientists into warriors and talks of killing children, as well as burning the heart-shaped herb. He's selfish and malevolent, too wrapped up in hatred to see straight. He's not a character to follow, but to pity, and his death was exactly that. He was someone who should've been by T'Challa's side from the start, and we see his potential wasted on hatred. Michael B. Jordan did such a good job in this role and deserves every commendation for it, but Killmonger wasn't a hero. To be a king you must be diplomatic and not a tyrant. He put his own selfish ambition and pride before he thought about his kingdom his people and race. 

“The sun will never set on the Wakandan empire.”

Spoken like a true colonialist and imperialist. Killmonger really is everything he’s fighting against.

Had Killmonger won and created his Wakandan Empire, it’s obvious how he’ll treat people of African descent and Anglo-Saxon descent 

But what about the other races, Latino, Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander, Indian, etc. 
many of these races and others had their share of being victimized by prejudice

Marvel,"Why are Marvel trading cards now so expensive, even 10x more than unopened boxes from the '90s?",False,41,0,"At 43, I decided to start rebuying some of my childhood by scouring eBay for unopened boxes of Marvel trading cards,ex. the Amazing Spider-man 1994 Fleer, or Marvel 1993 Skybox. However, in doing these searches, I also realized Marvel trading cards *still* existed -- as recently as 2023! Yet, when I saw the prices I was *stunned!* For example, a 2015 unopened box of Fleer Marvel cards is going for $5,999.95!! I bought two unopened boxes of 1994 Amazing Spider-man Fleer cards for $250 each!

What. is. happening?!

Marvel,Damn shame these games aren’t available for current gen consoles,False,637,0,"Ultimate Alliance 1 &amp; 2, the Spider-man games made by Activision (Shattered Dimensions, etc) and Deadpool, are absolutely awesome games.

I’m definitely not informed by the licensing system/agreement stuff, but I think Disney deciding to take these games off the market because of their conclusion with Activision and making them unavailable for current gen was a mistake. These are very fun games that were fairly creative with the Marvel universe. I grew up on the PS3 era with most of these games. And the fact that these games are only available on older consoles, or considerably more expensive than they should be on the secondary market just sucks. I feel sorry for the younger people that love gaming and Marvel that will completely look over these games or be unaware of them due to this licensing crap. Anyways sorry for the rant but it’s just a damn shame. What did you guys think of these games such as Ultimate Alliance, Deadpool and the Spider-man games?

Marvel,Ultimate Universe can gives a new interesting dynamic for a couple of characters,False,2,0,"Spoilers kinda: 

The teasers show us that Peter is becoming Spider-Man as an adult, married and with children. Considering he is now a family man there is something that to my knowledge we have not seen before in a Marvel Comic: 

First: the old Peter Parker - young Tony Stark relationship. We have always seen (due first the New Avengers run and later the MCU) a kind of mentor/protegee between Tony/Peter. Now that the ages are reversed we can have Peter play the old wise, experienced man to Tony”s reckless behavior as Iron Lad. 

Second: the Peter - Reed relationship. As usual Spider-Man mythos are deeply connected to Marvel’s first family, you can even say he is part of it. Reed has been in 616 a figure of respect and the rest of the FF have been his support during most of Spider-Man history. Now we can say that with Reed becoming the Ultimate Universe version of Doom, Peter is the the family man which Reed could eventually rely on, even becoming an extended member of the Parker family. 

Third: the Spider-Man - Captain America relationship. This maybe a long shot but as usual Steve “old/idealist” ways have always clashed with a futurist like Tony Stark, but considering that Tony is essentially a teen in this universe a better balance can be made between Peter and Steve. The clashing ideals of a man of an old age (Steve) and the man of the modern era (Peter)

How Would You Write It If You Were OneOf It's Writers?,False,1,0,"As we know, Daredevil has had his own solo movie with Ben Affleck, and two live-action television series in the MCU, with the second one coming soon. Today though, I wanna tackle a hypothetical scenario in which our favorite Man Without Fear goes into the realm of animation. I'm talking about a scenario in which Mavel announces that Daredevil is getting his own solo animated series, like Spider-Man and the X-Men did, and also is in it's own continuity. The actual show itself would be available to watch on Disney+.

How would you feel/react if Marvel announced an animated series for Daredevil?

Hickman is the anarchist Grant Morrison that delivers on every big idea and character moment. Will always be grateful for the best Reed/Doom moment ever in Secret Wars.

Ewing does the same but doesn’t get as big name projects and usually seems to support the “architects.” He really needs to headline/“drive”Avengers or X-Men. He straightened out Nextwave’s place if even just to bury it and his books are always fun at the very least.

Kieron Gillen might occupy this third spot but with just two character specific and relevant issues JMS has returned and made Captain America a must buy. This feels like it could be Cap’s equivalent to his Ezekiel and What are gods worth arcs from his previous works. Marvel, just let him cook. Do your Sieges and Wars somewhere else.",,24,,23,,public

I am so sick of the way peter has been written from Slott onwards. Peter Parker should not be Peter Pan. I'm tired of the character doing the same shit and constantly being regressed in annoying ways because someone at marvel thinks the character won't be relevant if he's ever really allowed to permanently grow up in 616/ASM.   


I get why they used to do this... but now we have miles. And miles means there is literally NO reason to keep doing this -- in fact spiderman overall as a brand would be so much better and peter and miles so much more differentiated if they would just stop this and let peter age up. Just let he and MJ be together. No more stupid will they won't they drama, write them going through the challenges of a LOVING couple who are nevertheless committed to each other raising a family. He doesn't have to stop being a hero because he's not a kid. It would be so much more interesting to see him juggle the responsibilities of a marriage/family with his responsibility as spiderman,   


The comic readership is no longer all 18 year olds and it never will be again. Let peter be for us older bros who grew up with him Let him be the wizened experienced vet who mentors Miles. If you wanna do some teenage young people bullshit in a comic book just use Miles. I'd rather see Peter struggling with guiding miles, trying to help him not make the same mistakes he's made, etc. The problems adults who care about the up and coming generation face -- I would gather at this point this would be MORE relateable to peter's core fanbase than the way they keep writing him.

Marvel,"Linear, A to B, clear storylines",False,2,0,"Hey everyone,

I'm teaching an elective class called History Through Marvel to 6th, 7th, and 8th graders this year. NYS has a concept called ""Enduring Issues"" that are basically overarching themes one can find all throughout history. For example: conflict, impact of technology, scarcity, etc. The goal of the class is to use those Enduring Issues themes to make connections between Marvel, history, and current events. 

In the class, we started with X-Men: The Animated Series and students easily made connections to the Enduring Issues theme of Human Rights, connecting the treatment of mutant kind to various events in history, particularly the Civil Rights Movement. Currently, we are in the process of reading the Secret Invasion storyline. Students are making connections but with a little less ease. I started with New Avengers Volumes 8 and 9 because I didn't realize Mighty Avengers Volumes 3 and 4 existed. I assume those take place before NA 8&amp;9 but we are reading them next anyway. Are there any other book collections in the Secret Invasion storyline that I'm missing? Book compliations are preferable to individual issues for the sake of the class. 

Aside from my mistake with NA 8&amp;9 and MA 3&amp;4, the students have struggled to follow the Secret Invasion storyline. I assume there are parts of the story I accidentally left out that would have provided more context for the events taking place in NA 8&amp;9 and MA 3&amp;4, but even so, it jumps around a lot and has been a little hard to follow.

I'm looking for recommendations for Marvel storylines that are more linear and have a more obviously defined beginning, middle, and end. Something a little more straightforward that the average middle school reader could easily follow.  

Thanks in advance for your recommendations!!",,1,,2,,public

Marvel,"Cover &amp; Synopsis Revealed for ""What If... Wanda Maximoff and Peter Parker Were Siblings?"" Novel by Seanan McGuire",False,119,0,"Wanda and Peter Parker embrace great responsibility in the next adventure of an epic multiversal series that reimages iconic Marvel origin stories.

So many worlds, so little time. Infinite possibilities, creating infinite realities. Long have I watched death court the Scarlet Witch. But . . . what if Wanda didn’t have to suffer her grief alone?

All Wanda has ever known is her friendly little neighborhood in Queens. As an infant, after her parents died, she was adopted into a family where her doting Aunt May and Uncle Ben will always be at the breakfast table. One that includes her idiot brother, Peter Parker, who thinks hiding a spider bite, joining a secret fight club, and becoming a superhero are somehow good ideas.

When Wanda’s own powers emerge, blood, chaos, and suspicion follow in their wake. But as she harnesses her power under the guidance of Doctor Strange, Peter is standing beside her in the Sanctum Sanctorum. And as they try to protect New York City, the Parker siblings learn that with great powers, there must also come great responsibilities—and greater loss.

Reeling from tragedy, Wanda finds herself truly alone for the first time in her life. Peter is lost to his own grief, and so she must strike out on her own. But on her first solo outing, she runs into a mysterious speedster—a man named Pietro. And everything she has ever known shatters like glass.

Faced with unbelievable truths, Wanda is forced to choose between the life she knows and the life she could have.

Stranvers aka Doctor Strange/Carol Danvers is one of mine. I don't love it, it's the Clea/Strange life for me, but I don't get the hate either. I just think it's neat. Maybe I have a hitherto unheard of weakness for a flying brick dating a wizard. Imagine them as a fighting duo, Stephen enhancing Carol's punches with magic? 😩😩😩

Also, VoodooWitch aka Jericho Drumm/Wanda Maximoff. The comics casually forgetting they were even dating made me feel bad for Jericho lol in the right hands, this relationship could be very interesting. They have a good amount of shared lore already, tbh. I've always thought Wanda would do better dating a fellow magic user. And Jericho is also a mental health professional. This is meant to be y'all.

Marvel,How does the Cosmic Ring/Freedom Ring’s power work?,False,7,0,"Hey guys. Last night I came across a video on youtube about heroes who are not known and Freedom Ring was one of them. I was just confused by how the rings’ powers worked. I thought Cosmic Cubes are like wish granting objects in a way wherein all you needed was to speak/think what you want and it’ll happen, I assumed the Cosmic Ring did the same since it came from a fragment of a Cosmic Cube, just a much weaker way since the range the ring affects reality is capped at 30 feet.

In another video it stated that Curtis Doyle had to concentrate for them to be able to get up when they were paralyzed, but on another part of the comic they simply thought about ice cream for it to appear.

My question now is, had they stopped concentrating would the ice cream disappear? 

Couldn’t they just ‘wished’ to be able to walk and the ring would grant them that? 

If he wished himself indestructible why were they impaled? 

If they were beside a table and wished for ice cream on top of it and moved more than 30 feet away from said table would the ice cream disappear or would it have stayed?

Marvel,Which Spider-Man movie is better?,False,28,0,,,51,,28,,public
Marvel,What would it look like if every mutant was as powerful as possible while staying stable and in control of their powers?,False,6,0,"hat would it look like if every mutant was as powerful as possible while staying stable and in control of their powers?

What if Cyclops fully actualized his potential and had complete control over his powers? 

What if it was Jubilee, Cypher, Wolverine, Nightcrawler, or Angel? 

I think we might be already seeing this with Iceman but can you imagine if Storm truly worked on what it means to command the cosmic storm! Or musical winds that blow between dimensions? 

I think it's really neat to think of Blob with omega level gravity powers and him being extremely skilled with them. 

Here is one way we could see it. 

What if all this time what Beast has been secretly working on has been infiltrating and assimilating the genetic engineering knowledge of the High Evolutionary, the Deviants, the Inhumans, Sinister, Apocalypse, and others? Now he has perfected a variant of the Terrigen Mists that unlocks any mutants full potential and grants them instinctive knowledge of how to use that potential without becoming unstable? 

I imagine of course he would test it on him self and finds that he has been transformed into a basic human shape but is now a shape shifter that can take on any superpowered animalistic forms he can imagine,like a bat form for the air and a seal form for the sea. No matter what form he takes he still has his super strength, speed, endurance, agility, pheromone control, heightened senses, healing factor, and maintains his genius intellect. 

Marvel editorial would make it temporary or something because having all mutants permanently powered up would break too many stories but even if they could use it for temporary boosts I think it would be cool. 

Who would you want to see with their full potential powers unlocked and what do you imagine they would be like?

Do you think Marvel would ever allow such a story?

The thing is, I logged on and saw just how many comics there were and decided I couldn't skip them all, because my brain hates that. So I made a compromise; I would only read comics relating to the 616 universe. In my head, that made sense and was a reasonable adjustment.

I have been following Travis Starnes' 616 reading list and have been fast approaching comic number 50. I just finished reach the Fantastic Four's first encounter with the Hulk.

So I skipped to the end and saw that there are a whopping 34,118 comics so far, undoubtedly more as I keep reading. 

I've read 46.

I won't stop however. These comics are gold, and I've really fallen in love with them, even if currently the enemies are inevitably the Russians at every turn.

At this rate, I should be done in roughly 1483 months (or just over 123 years), so I'll probably be picking up the pace a little now. Previously I was just reading on my laptop but I've added my phone to my arsenal to help things along.

While the comment made me laugh, I thought about it and it does appear that a lot of MCU writers really do seem to dislike certain characters that goes beyond simply Disconstructions, and ""Disassemblings"" for the sake of an interesting story, or just not knowing what to do with a character ( because lets' face it any title that has run continuously for 60+ years has probably run the gamut of new ideas ).  


Then I thought about characters like Hank Pym, or Tony Stark, that some writers clearly dislike and wondered has anybody else noticed a character that either writers ( or even the editors ) just don't like?",,188,,126,,public

Marvel,Was MCU Thanos Actually Right? (Eternals tie-in),False,0,0,"I've never been wild about 616 Thanos in the comics. He's had a couple of great story arcs but Jim Starlin's proprietary interest in his version of the character stunted his development to some extent. The anthropomorphic, regularly appearing version of abstract cosmic entities into 616 has slowly rendered what should be distant, alien and incomprehensible beings into just one more kind of gaudy superhero/supervillain, and never more so than in the idea that Thanos is in love with and regularly speaks to Death.

Like a lot of people, I found the MCU Thanos to work pretty well in the two highlight films that he's central to (Infinity War and Endgame). He's menacing, powerful, reflective, a bit melancholy, but also petty, especially his time-jumping version who shows up for the big battle in Endgame. But as many people have observed, his ultimate goal seems if anything to make even less sense than being in love with Death, a cosmic abstraction who appears to him as an attractive partner. 

Until Eternals, in a way that I don't see a lot of people talking about. I didn't love Eternals, but if you follow what they introduce about the nature of the Celestials, it may make Thanos' plan make a dramatic new kind of sense, to the point that he might be 'right' technically. E.g., the Celestials hatch from planets inhabited by sapient beings *who have reached a certain level of population and technology*, destroying those beings but preserving a balance that keeps entropy at bay. Suppose it turns out that Thanos' plan was based on him *learning the truth* about the Celestials and deciding that in order to preserve intelligent species across the universe, they all had to have their populations cut in half to extend the time they had before a Celestial emergence destroyed them completely. Which in a weird way also makes him an ally of Death (entropy) because he's impeding the emergence of enough Celestials to prevent the universe tilting towards entropy. 

It actually all adds up--and it might explain what's going on with the appearance of Eros at the end of the Eternals film. It doesn't *seem* at the moment that this is going to be a Chekov's gun that will drop in The Kang Dynasty or Secret Wars and yet it's possible to imagine how it might. E.g., if the threat of the Kangs turns out to be just a distraction from the Celestials basically stepping in to be the Beyonders of Hickman's Avengers/Secret Wars, that they were alarmed enough by Thanos' use of the Infinity Gauntlet that they decide to destroy the multiverse and start over, only to be opposed by some assembly of various multiversal characters (possibly including some of the folks on board the spaceship at the end of Eternals). And it might be interesting for any OG Avengers who get involved to learn that Thanos was responding to a real threat, if by means that were as almost as bad as space-giants emerging from inside of sapient planets. (It might also be interesting if it turns out that the few really advanced and powerful alien civilizations encountered so far--Kree, Xandar--turn out to be civilizations that either killed their Celestial or that learned how to keep their population levels just low enough to avoid Celestial emergence.)

Marvel,Dreamy Thoughts on Marvel Spotlight.,False,17,0,"I hope that its similar to the cw shows in structure where they mostly have independent stories and maybe occasionally cross. But arent beholden to the stroct structure of the films. 

Darkhawk is PRIME for a tv show. He doesnt have a fanbase and could be crafted anew. He has cool  powers    and would make for a great cheap monster of the week style show. 

Stilt man needs to debut already. Hes been referenced a million times already. Id like the show to open with a montage of mcu heroes kicking his ass for petty crimes. He then decides to change and try to be a hero. This could be a family show where he comes from a family of criminals who are trying to change. 

3D man is a very obscure guy. He too like DH has cool powers. An aventure show with him could be very unique and quirky. He was also a MVP during secret invasion in the comics. 

Heroes for hire. We ALL been asking for it. They should ignore all the previous events and just launch with luke and danny kicking ass across the marvel universe. A buddy cop procedural is TV 101. I dont know why we already arent on season 7 of a heroes for hire show.",,2,,17,,public

Just a witch supporting a fellow witch. I won’t make this post too long but I wanted to share my love the Scarlet Witch who’s been a big part of my life.

I’ve been following her for a very long time and essentially bought every digital comic she’s been in all the way back to her first appearance X-Men #4 (1964).

A big shout out to my favourite artists:

Russell Dauterman, Lorenzo Tammetta and Sara Pichelli for their amazing work during the newest Scarlet Witch series. I phased out of physical copies awhile ago, but the moment I saw them working on Scarlet Witch, I had to get physical copies and have them on display. 

In the future I will have these framed along with my other prints from Russell Dauterman, David Nakayama and other artists, but for now, this is my little “altar” dedicated to my favourite witch.

Still waiting on 3 statues from hot toys to come in as well but I know this case will continue to grow overtime! :D ",,3,,3,,public

A stunt actor was killed in a terrible car accident in Georgia along with three of his children, one of whom was a newborn baby.

The other two children in the car, a 10-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl also died, while one child, a three-year-old, is in the hospital with severe injuries but is expected to recover.

The fatal car crash happened on an exit ramp on Interstate 20 in Dekalb County, Georgia. Taraja Ramsess, a stunt actor famous for his roles in Avengers movies, was driving a pickup truck with all of his children on Halloween night when it collided with a tractor-trailer. The impact killed the 41-year-old father, the 13-year-old Sundari Ramsess, and the newborn, Fugibo Ramsess, immediately, reported

Marvel,"Who's more powerful, Hawkeye or Angel?",False,2,0,"My assumptions are that, 

Hawkeye is basically a normal human who's trained a lot with archery and has access to Stark tech for his weapons. 

Angel is a moderately powerful mutant who was exposed to a death seed by apocalypse, which vastly expanded his powers, developed a secondary mutation which gave him a healing factor and the ability to heal others, and is a billionaire so could probably have access to Stark tech or have Forge make weapons for him if he so wished. 

They are both members of powerful teams and have years if not decades of superhero experience at this point. 

So I think this is an easy win for Angel but I know he's one of the least popular X-Men and Hawkeye has some popularity as an avenger so I'm interested to see how this conversation goes.",,22,,2,,public

Marvel,Do you agree with what marvel said about peter parker in end of the spiderverse #5? That him becoming spiderman ruined his life?,False,112,0,"In a world where Peter Parker was never bitten by a radioactive spider, his life is absolutely perfect, starting from the fact that his uncle Ben is alive. The infamous burglar attacked the Parkers in their house, but Peter jumped in front of the bullet. This maimed him in one leg but also turned him into a hero, making him incredibly popular at school and earning the respect of Flash Thompson, who became Peter's best friend. The young Parker was able to balance his intense social life with his studies, graduating with an Osborn scholarship and going to ESU with Flash, after which Peter landed a job as a scientist for Oscorp. In Spider-Man's absence, his role was taken by the other person who was bitten by the radioactive spider, Cindy Moon, aka Silk, who became New York's prominent hero.Even in this new life, Peter Parker felt the urge of doing something heroic, so he became Silk's ""tech guy"", building her gadgets and acting as her support.

Marvel,I really feel like the Weapon Plus Program (as originally envisioned by Grant Morrison) was a fantastic idea that COULD have been used to connect so much in the Marvel Universe…and they squandered the hell out of it.,False,15,0,"Or, to quote “The Bourne Legacy” in regards to every writer that’s touched the concept after Morrison created it for Marvel:

“You were given a Ferrari and your people treated it like a lawnmower”

Like…how do you screw up something SO PURE and SIMPLE as a classic “behind the scenes government conspiracy that connects the dots on previously unrelated characters” literary trope??? Morrison laid out all the damn rules and what each number did…and then they just retconned the ever-living shit out of most of it and BARELY followed the original concept!

Why wasn’t Rocket Raccoon a product of Weapon II or III, as well as other animal-based heroes and villains? Hell, even have The High Evolutionary’s New Men looped into the program and be responsible for their creation! “II” would have been cybernetically enhancing animals, while “III” would have been using genetic modification to create animal/human hybrids!

Testing on ethnicities and prisoners (IV and V) was a fucking klaxon call screaming “Luke Cage”…and they STILL found a way to fuck it up and make Luke’s creation part of a WHOLLY DIFFERENT PROGRAM (the next one, VI), while using one (IV) to be responsible for MAN-THING, and capitalizing on “V” for the other and using it to create “Sym-Soldiers” (wounded soldiers with a symbiote grafted to them) instead because “Venom” starts with a “V”?!!? Such poverty of imagination…🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻

This is ESPECIALLY egregious because both the German AND United States governments had been studying American Super-Soldier John Steele’s body since AT LEAST 1918, and this man possessed superhuman strength and INDESTRUCTIBLE SKIN…and NOBODY THOUGHT TO TIE THIS INTO THE MOST POPULAR CHARACTER WITH THE SAME ABILITIES WHO WAS ALSO A BYPRODUCT OF THESE PROGRAMS?!!?

Weapon VII they did fine with, so I have no notes there. A rare win with this concept…but then again, it’s pretty tough to screw up cybernetic-enhancements 🤷🏻

Then, virtually NOTHING with Weapon VIII, which was supposed to create sleeper soldiers and assassins using drugs and hypnosis, and could be fantastic if they ever decide to tie it to like, the Red Room or the Widow Program…so I guess we’ll see 🤷🏻

IX being responsible for the creation of Typhoid Mary via “Project Psyche” seems like a nice segway from “mind control” and “personality-alteration”, to “Mutants”, so I’d say another W so far.

After that, I can’t say as I have any problems with it, as THAT PART was utilized immediately by Morrison.

With “X” it began turning Mutants into living weapons, which eventually branched out into its own program, while XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, and XVI continued on, with the only one not really touched on being “XI”.

“0” was revealed to be the African-American soldiers experimented on with the prototype version of Cap’s serum, and Cap being “Weapon I”…and I loved that too. Everything that followed was an attempt to recapture the “lightning in a bottle” miracle of Steve’s creation, and it works beautifully conceptually…but instead of just sliding the correct pieces into place like a puzzle with the rest, it was transformed into a patchwork, Frankenstein-esque abomination that jammed square pegs into round holes, and tried to convince us it was everything BUT 🤦🏻

One of my biggest gripes is that there was nothing SPECIFICALLY for alien beings, or supernatural creatures.

Why were the Sym-Soldiers created around Symbiotes, when grafting a variety of different alien genetic material from different species to wounded soldiers is a MUCH COOLER concept??? Skrull, Kree, Shi’ar, Inhuman, and Symbiote DNA could’ve created some amazing characters, and formed the basis for a SWORD strike force of human soldiers with alien abilities that defend against extraterrestrial threats…not just a synergistic one-off to tie-in to a Venom-centric crossover event.

A program number devoted to supernatural creatures could have explained the origins of the “Howling Commandos” SHIELD squad, and looped in Hannibal King, Blade, the Midnight Sons/Suns…and yet, we got nothing 🤷🏻🤦🏻😔

What a waste… 🙄🤦🏻",,3,,15,,public

Marvel,Why are so many people saying Killmonger from Black Panther is a “good guy”?,False,14,0,"I've heard too many people say that his plan was a good one, and that he should've won. But listen to his speech. He believes in oppression and genocide. He's turning a peaceful nation of scientists into warriors and talks of killing children, as well as burning the heart-shaped herb. He's selfish and malevolent, too wrapped up in hatred to see straight. He's not a character to follow, but to pity, and his death was exactly that. He was someone who should've been by T'Challa's side from the start, and we see his potential wasted on hatred. Michael B. Jordan did such a good job in this role and deserves every commendation for it, but Killmonger wasn't a hero. To be a king you must be diplomatic and not a tyrant. He put his own selfish ambition and pride before he thought about his kingdom his people and race. 

“The sun will never set on the Wakandan empire.”

Spoken like a true colonialist and imperialist. Killmonger really is everything he’s fighting against.

Had Killmonger won and created his Wakandan Empire, it’s obvious how he’ll treat people of African descent and Anglo-Saxon descent 

But what about the other races, Latino, Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander, Indian, etc. 
many of these races and others had their share of being victimized by prejudice 

Would they In Killmonger’s world be treated any different? Or would they be victims too as in his likely Wakandan Surpremist world, those not of direct African descent would be treated inferior yes?",,19,,14,,public

Not to mention the sheer volume of content he has to his name.

That said, my second pick would be Wolverine, and for most of the same reasons (seriously, I’m hard pressed to think of a team that HASN’T had him on the roster at some point or other) though he also has the addition of being old as shit and having been through more shit (like fighting in WWII with Cap and Fury)",,83,,3,,public

It’s only after Uncle Ben dies that he decides to use his powers for good.

Hickman is the anarchist Grant Morrison that delivers on every big idea and character moment. Will always be grateful for the best Reed/Doom moment ever in Secret Wars.

Ewing does the same but doesn’t get as big name projects and usually seems to support the “architects.” He really needs to headline/“drive”Avengers or X-Men. He straightened out Nextwave’s place if even just to bury it and his books are always fun at the very least.

Kieron Gillen might occupy this third spot but with just two character specific and relevant issues JMS has returned and made Captain America a must buy. This feels like it could be Cap’s equivalent to his Ezekiel and What are gods worth arcs from his previous works. Marvel, just let him cook. Do your Sieges and Wars somewhere else.",,24,,22,,public

Marvel,"Now that Miles is around, Marvel needs to give Peter his marriage back and let him grow up",False,163,0,"First of all, been reading ASM for 20 years since I was a little boy. i was so young with the clone saga came out I thought it was good.   


I am so sick of the way peter has been written from Slott onwards. Peter Parker should not be Peter Pan. I'm tired of the character doing the same shit and constantly being regressed in annoying ways because someone at marvel thinks the character won't be relevant if he's ever really allowed to permanently grow up in 616/ASM.   


I get why they used to do this... but now we have miles. And miles means there is literally NO reason to keep doing this -- in fact spiderman overall as a brand would be so much better and peter and miles so much more differentiated if they would just stop this and let peter age up. Just let he and MJ be together. No more stupid will they won't they drama, write them going through the challenges of a LOVING couple who are nevertheless committed to each other raising a family. He doesn't have to stop being a hero because he's not a kid. It would be so much more interesting to see him juggle the responsibilities of a marriage/family with his responsibility as spiderman,   


The comic readership is no longer all 18 year olds and it never will be again. Let peter be for us older bros who grew up with him Let him be the wizened experienced vet who mentors Miles. If you wanna do some teenage young people bullshit in a comic book just use Miles. I'd rather see Peter struggling with guiding miles, trying to help him not make the same mistakes he's made, etc. The problems adults who care about the up and coming generation face -- I would gather at this point this would be MORE relateable to peter's core fanbase than the way they keep writing him.

Marvel,"Linear, A to B, clear storylines",False,4,0,"Hey everyone,

I'm teaching an elective class called History Through Marvel to 6th, 7th, and 8th graders this year. NYS has a concept called ""Enduring Issues"" that are basically overarching themes one can find all throughout history. For example: conflict, impact of technology, scarcity, etc. The goal of the class is to use those Enduring Issues themes to make connections between Marvel, history, and current events. 

In the class, we started with X-Men: The Animated Series and students easily made connections to the Enduring Issues theme of Human Rights, connecting the treatment of mutant kind to various events in history, particularly the Civil Rights Movement. Currently, we are in the process of reading the Secret Invasion storyline. Students are making connections but with a little less ease. I started with New Avengers Volumes 8 and 9 because I didn't realize Mighty Avengers Volumes 3 and 4 existed. I assume those take place before NA 8&amp;9 but we are reading them next anyway. Are there any other book collections in the Secret Invasion storyline that I'm missing? Book compliations are preferable to individual issues for the sake of the class. 

Aside from my mistake with NA 8&amp;9 and MA 3&amp;4, the students have struggled to follow the Secret Invasion storyline. I assume there are parts of the story I accidentally left out that would have provided more context for the events taking place in NA 8&amp;9 and MA 3&amp;4, but even so, it jumps around a lot and has been a little hard to follow.

I'm looking for recommendations for Marvel storylines that are more linear and have a more obviously defined beginning, middle, and end. Something a little more straightforward that the average middle school reader could easily follow.

Marvel,"Cover &amp; Synopsis Revealed for ""What If... Wanda Maximoff and Peter Parker Were Siblings?"" Novel by Seanan McGuire",False,120,0,"Wanda and Peter Parker embrace great responsibility in the next adventure of an epic multiversal series that reimages iconic Marvel origin stories.

So many worlds, so little time. Infinite possibilities, creating infinite realities. Long have I watched death court the Scarlet Witch. But . . . what if Wanda didn’t have to suffer her grief alone?

All Wanda has ever known is her friendly little neighborhood in Queens. As an infant, after her parents died, she was adopted into a family where her doting Aunt May and Uncle Ben will always be at the breakfast table. One that includes her idiot brother, Peter Parker, who thinks hiding a spider bite, joining a secret fight club, and becoming a superhero are somehow good ideas.

When Wanda’s own powers emerge, blood, chaos, and suspicion follow in their wake. But as she harnesses her power under the guidance of Doctor Strange, Peter is standing beside her in the Sanctum Sanctorum. And as they try to protect New York City, the Parker siblings learn that with great powers, there must also come great responsibilities—and greater loss.

Reeling from tragedy, Wanda finds herself truly alone for the first time in her life. Peter is lost to his own grief, and so she must strike out on her own. But on her first solo outing, she runs into a mysterious speedster—a man named Pietro. And everything she has ever known shatters like glass.

Faced with unbelievable truths, Wanda is forced to choose between the life she knows and the life she could have.

Marvel,Did anyone else know this about Eros?,False,0,0,"I found it on the MCU Wiki.

*Eros was created by Arishem the Judge and was stationed along with nine other Eternals on Titan. There, he joined the royal family of Titan and was given the mantle of Prince, becoming the adoptive brother of Thanos. Prior to Titan's demise, Eros rebelled against Arishem and fled Titan, becoming an outlaw. While traveling through the cosmos, he created Pip the Troll to be his companion. Following a trip to Mystery Planet, Eros was given the name Starfox.*

*On one journey, Eros and Pip the Troll encountered a being called Black Roger. When Black Roger was deemed an adversary, Eros defeated him. This act greatly affected Pip, who admired Eros and went on to introduce him to those they met as the defeater of Black Roger.*

*In 2024, upon learning about Arishem’s judgment, Eros transported himself alongside Pip to the Domo, where he met with three Eternals, Thena, Makkari, and Druig. Druig asked him why they were there and Eros, with a Celestial Communication Sphere in his hands, declared that he knew where their friends were, offering his partnership.*

Where does this information come from? A producer or something? Because none of this was mentioned in his little scene in the movie. And Eros seems like a pretty powerful Eternal if he was able to create life from scratch. Curious to see what his MCU powers really are (I don't think he'll have the same powers that he ahs in the comics).

Marvel,What would it look like if every mutant was as powerful as possible while staying stable and in control of their powers?,False,3,0,"hat would it look like if every mutant was as powerful as possible while staying stable and in control of their powers?

What if Cyclops fully actualized his potential and had complete control over his powers? 

What if it was Jubilee, Cypher, Wolverine, Nightcrawler, or Angel? 

I think we might be already seeing this with Iceman but can you imagine if Storm truly worked on what it means to command the cosmic storm! Or musical winds that blow between dimensions? 

I think it's really neat to think of Blob with omega level gravity powers and him being extremely skilled with them. 

Here is one way we could see it. 

What if all this time what Beast has been secretly working on has been infiltrating and assimilating the genetic engineering knowledge of the High Evolutionary, the Deviants, the Inhumans, Sinister, Apocalypse, and others? Now he has perfected a variant of the Terrigen Mists that unlocks any mutants full potential and grants them instinctive knowledge of how to use that potential without becoming unstable? 

I imagine of course he would test it on him self and finds that he has been transformed into a basic human shape but is now a shape shifter that can take on any superpowered animalistic forms he can imagine,like a bat form for the air and a seal form for the sea. No matter what form he takes he still has his super strength, speed, endurance, agility, pheromone control, heightened senses, healing factor, and maintains his genius intellect. 

Marvel editorial would make it temporary or something because having all mutants permanently powered up would break too many stories but even if they could use it for temporary boosts I think it would be cool. 

Who would you want to see with their full potential powers unlocked and what do you imagine they would be like?

The thing is, I logged on and saw just how many comics there were and decided I couldn't skip them all, because my brain hates that. So I made a compromise; I would only read comics relating to the 616 universe. In my head, that made sense and was a reasonable adjustment.

I have been following Travis Starnes' 616 reading list and have been fast approaching comic number 50. I just finished reach the Fantastic Four's first encounter with the Hulk.

So I skipped to the end and saw that there are a whopping 34,118 comics so far, undoubtedly more as I keep reading. 

I've read 46.

I won't stop however. These comics are gold, and I've really fallen in love with them, even if currently the enemies are inevitably the Russians at every turn.

At this rate, I should be done in roughly 1483 months (or just over 123 years), so I'll probably be picking up the pace a little now. Previously I was just reading on my laptop but I've added my phone to my arsenal to help things along.

Very good vid btw, but in one of the comments someone wrote: ""Marvel writers hate Peter so much, they had to make a second one to torture twice as hard"".  


While the comment made me laugh, I thought about it and it does appear that a lot of MCU writers really do seem to dislike certain characters that goes beyond simply Disconstructions, and ""Disassemblings"" for the sake of an interesting story, or just not knowing what to do with a character ( because lets' face it any title that has run continuously for 60+ years has probably run the gamut of new ideas ).  


Then I thought about characters like Hank Pym, or Tony Stark, that some writers clearly dislike and wondered has anybody else noticed a character that either writers ( or even the editors ) just don't like?",,188,,127,,public

Marvel,Was MCU Thanos Actually Right? (Eternals tie-in),False,1,0,"I've never been wild about 616 Thanos in the comics. He's had a couple of great story arcs but Jim Starlin's proprietary interest in his version of the character stunted his development to some extent. The anthropomorphic, regularly appearing version of abstract cosmic entities into 616 has slowly rendered what should be distant, alien and incomprehensible beings into just one more kind of gaudy superhero/supervillain, and never more so than in the idea that Thanos is in love with and regularly speaks to Death.

Like a lot of people, I found the MCU Thanos to work pretty well in the two highlight films that he's central to (Infinity War and Endgame). He's menacing, powerful, reflective, a bit melancholy, but also petty, especially his time-jumping version who shows up for the big battle in Endgame. But as many people have observed, his ultimate goal seems if anything to make even less sense than being in love with Death, a cosmic abstraction who appears to him as an attractive partner. 

Until Eternals, in a way that I don't see a lot of people talking about. I didn't love Eternals, but if you follow what they introduce about the nature of the Celestials, it may make Thanos' plan make a dramatic new kind of sense, to the point that he might be 'right' technically. E.g., the Celestials hatch from planets inhabited by sapient beings *who have reached a certain level of population and technology*, destroying those beings but preserving a balance that keeps entropy at bay. Suppose it turns out that Thanos' plan was based on him *learning the truth* about the Celestials and deciding that in order to preserve intelligent species across the universe, they all had to have their populations cut in half to extend the time they had before a Celestial emergence destroyed them completely. Which in a weird way also makes him an ally of Death (entropy) because he's impeding the emergence of enough Celestials to prevent the universe tilting towards entropy. 

It actually all adds up--and it might explain what's going on with the appearance of Eros at the end of the Eternals film. It doesn't *seem* at the moment that this is going to be a Chekov's gun that will drop in The Kang Dynasty or Secret Wars and yet it's possible to imagine how it might. E.g., if the threat of the Kangs turns out to be just a distraction from the Celestials basically stepping in to be the Beyonders of Hickman's Avengers/Secret Wars, that they were alarmed enough by Thanos' use of the Infinity Gauntlet that they decide to destroy the multiverse and start over, only to be opposed by some assembly of various multiversal characters (possibly including some of the folks on board the spaceship at the end of Eternals). And it might be interesting for any OG Avengers who get involved to learn that Thanos was responding to a real threat, if by means that were as almost as bad as space-giants emerging from inside of sapient planets. (It might also be interesting if it turns out that the few really advanced and powerful alien civilizations encountered so far--Kree, Xandar--turn out to be civilizations that either killed their Celestial or that learned how to keep their population levels just low enough to avoid Celestial emergence.)

Darkhawk is PRIME for a tv show. He doesnt have a fanbase and could be crafted anew. He has cool  powers    and would make for a great cheap monster of the week style show. 

Stilt man needs to debut already. Hes been referenced a million times already. Id like the show to open with a montage of mcu heroes kicking his ass for petty crimes. He then decides to change and try to be a hero. This could be a family show where he comes from a family of criminals who are trying to change. 

3D man is a very obscure guy. He too like DH has cool powers. An aventure show with him could be very unique and quirky. He was also a MVP during secret invasion in the comics. 

Heroes for hire. We ALL been asking for it. They should ignore all the previous events and just launch with luke and danny kicking ass across the marvel universe. A buddy cop procedural is TV 101. I dont know why we already arent on season 7 of a heroes for hire show.",,2,,19,,public

Just a witch supporting a fellow witch. I won’t make this post too long but I wanted to share my love the Scarlet Witch who’s been a big part of my life.

I’ve been following her for a very long time and essentially bought every digital comic she’s been in all the way back to her first appearance X-Men #4 (1964).

A big shout out to my favourite artists:

Russell Dauterman, Lorenzo Tammetta and Sara Pichelli for their amazing work during the newest Scarlet Witch series. I phased out of physical copies awhile ago, but the moment I saw them working on Scarlet Witch, I had to get physical copies and have them on display. 

In the future I will have these framed along with my other prints from Russell Dauterman, David Nakayama and other artists, but for now, this is my little “altar” dedicated to my favourite witch.

Hawkeye is basically a normal human who's trained a lot with archery and has access to Stark tech for his weapons. 

Angel is a moderately powerful mutant who was exposed to a death seed by apocalypse, which vastly expanded his powers, developed a secondary mutation which gave him a healing factor and the ability to heal others, and is a billionaire so could probably have access to Stark tech or have Forge make weapons for him if he so wished. 

They are both members of powerful teams and have years if not decades of superhero experience at this point. 

So I think this is an easy win for Angel but I know he's one of the least popular X-Men and Hawkeye has some popularity as an avenger so I'm interested to see how this conversation goes.",,22,,1,,public

The young Parker was able to balance his intense social life with his studies, graduating with an Osborn scholarship and going to ESU with Flash, after which Peter landed a job as a scientist for Oscorp. In Spider-Man's absence, his role was taken by the other person who was bitten by the radioactive spider, Cindy Moon, aka Silk, who became New York's prominent hero.Even in this new life, Peter Parker felt the urge of doing something heroic, so he became Silk's ""tech guy"", building her gadgets and acting as her support.
